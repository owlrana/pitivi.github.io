Check out how to set up your dev env and come in our IRC channel \nThe integration tests are run with GstValidate. They are located in the tests validate tests directory. Each scenario file in the scenarios subdirectory contains a sequence of actions which represent a test. \nWhen a test is run the actions in the scenario are performed by handlers in pitivi utils validate.py or by handlers in GES. The handlers generally act on the widgets and check the expected effect has been obtained on the GES objects. Besides the checks integrated in the handlers for now it is not possible to have additional checks. \nA scenario file is created automatically each time Pitivi is used. \nYou can run the integration tests with \n"});
