I have found a legitimate video editor for Linux that is more powerful than Lightworks that uses the latest GTK technologies and it s available to run right now with one download no proprietary counter. It s Pitivi. They just had a brand new version and it s a huge huge deal. I m not joking this is a really big deal. They ve been essentially working on this release for over a year and they have done SO. MUCH. WORK. It s almost an entirely new product. They ve redone everything. This looks like an actual video editor If you re familiar with Final Cut this is going to be a familiar editing experience for you. This is a whole new deal. I m excited. \nChris Fisher on the Linux Action Show episode from to mins \nPitivi es uno de los mejores editores de v deo para Linux que he se puede encontrar en la actualidad. La interfaz es sencilla y agradable a la vista no hay complicaciones de ning n tipo una de esas perlas de software que no se ven a menudo y que conviene tener siempre a mano. translated One of the best video editors for Linux that I can find today. The interface is simple and pleasing to the eye no complications... a rare gem that you don t see often in the software world and something you should have on hand. \nUpToDown September \nIt is a testimony to Pitivi s stability that the only problems I found with it were minor. Obviously the big plus is the vast assortment of effects available and how easy they are to configure and use. But the collective effect of the UI improvements settings presets detachable tabs and other enhancements fully adjustable frame rates media previews make for a better editing experience as well. \nLinux.com July th \nWhat impresses me about Pitivi isn t so much that it s a flexible multimedia editor we have a handful of those already in the Linux community. What I think sets Pitivi apart is that it makes video editing intuitive. I don t generally create or edit video files but I was able to jump right in with this application. I didn t have any need for a manual or tutorial Pitivi has an interface which allows people to learn by doing without a bunch of scary options or jargon. Almost everything is drag n drop with this editor and I feel it lowers the bar for people interested in putting together their own videos. \nDistroWatch October th \nI have to say the work Thibault and the Pitivi guys have done is incredible. Truly. The wide selection of effects and the ease in which they can be added used is so simple and user intuitive it can t help but stoke your creative fire. The process for editing adjusting clip effects in Pitivi certainly scores one up here. Where OpenShot hides effect preferences behind right clicks and extra windows Pitivi puts them slapbang where you can see and access them equalling a usability plus. All of this is done in real time too As soon as you drag an effect on a clip it s instantly applied. This makes workflow irrepressibly speedy you can see what works and what doesn t straight away. I am utterly utterly astounded by the quality handling fantastic interface this has gained in such a short amount of time. It is a absolute credit to the talents of the team behind this and it s not even released yet \nOMG Ubuntu on the inclusion of special effects in September \nOverall Pitivi is a promising application. It s a decent video editor with no frills and intuitive to pick up. And in the tests I ran Pitivi was rock solid. This isn t something to be taken for granted. Years ago I spent time editing video with Kino for various projects and learned to save after nearly every edit or operation. \nars technica February st \n"});
