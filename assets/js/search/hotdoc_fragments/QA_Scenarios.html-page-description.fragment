update continuously while the mouse is moving\n\n\nthe trimming handles at the start and end of the clips should highlight as the mouse moves over them\nthe clip should move smoothly, even when vigorously scrubbed back and forth\nthe viewer should not update during this operation this will change when we support live previews\n\nif thumbnails are enabled, they should appear properly even while the clip is being moved\nthe clip should snap to the edges of other clips, but not to its original coordinates\ncheck that audio track moves downward so that tracks do not intermingle\nwhen moved beyond the edges of the timeline window, the timeline should scroll\nwhen moving leftward from the right edge (end) of the timeline, there should be no change in scroll position unless the clip moves past the left edge of the timeline.\nyou should not be able to move the start of the clip past the beginning of the timeline\nat all times the shaded portion of the timeline ruler should show
