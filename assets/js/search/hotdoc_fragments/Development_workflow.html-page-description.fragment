Feel free to open a task if you have found a bug or wish to see a feature implemented. If it already exists subscribe to it to keep yourself updated with its progress. You can also subscribe to the entire project. \nTo get involved you can start with tasks tagged Pitivi tasks for newcomers. It s best to get in touch with us on our IRC channel pitivi on Freenode to see if it s still meaningful. \nOnce you decide assign the task to yourself in Phabricator. \nNext is the fun part where you implement your cool feature or fix an annoying bug \nCreate a new branch with a relevant name in your local git repository. The name must start with the task ID. \nFor example if you re going to work on task T7674 titled Traceback when selecting a JPG file in the import dialog the branch could be called T7674 import img \nOnce you have made your changes commit them in your local git repository. Follow the GNOME guidelines for creating commits. \nBe aware that when you create a commit pre commit is executed to perform checks on the changes. In some cases it does some automatic fixes when this happens make sure those are included in the commit you want to create. \nNow you re all set to push your first diff to Phabricator for review \nIf there is no tracking information for the current branch git phab will complain as it won t be able to figure out what your changes are. You can specify the tracked branch like this \nAttaching does many things \nCreates multiple Differential Revisions representing each of your unattached commits and updates the ones already attached. See for example D1617. \nAmends the message of the previously unattached commits so they contain the associated Differential Revision URL. See for example b6a1384dbeef. \nFinds out the Task ID from the branch name. \nAttaches the Differential Revisions to the Task. \nPushes your branch to a staging git repo so we can try exactly what you did. \nWe ll get an automatic email and then review it ASAP. \nFor those of you familiar with Phabricator s tool for managing revisions pay attention arc creates a single revision for the entire branch while our git phab attaches each commit in the branch as a separate revision. \nOptionally you can set git phab to push your branches to a personal remote repository when you attach \nAdd your cloned remote Pitivi repository as a remote to your local repository \nSet git phab remote to your cloned remote Pitivi repository \n"});
