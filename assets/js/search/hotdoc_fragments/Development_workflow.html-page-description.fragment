Most of the time you assign an issue to yourself work on it until it s fixed and then you close it. \nInterested users can enable notifications for an existing issue to get an email when it s updated. It s also possible to change your Notification settings for pitivi from the default Global to Watch to receive notifications for any activity in the entire project. \nTo get involved start with issues tagged Newcomers. It s best to get in touch with us on our IRC channel pitivi on Freenode to see if it s still meaningful. \nOnce you decide assign the issue to yourself in GitLab. \nNext is the fun part where you implement your cool feature or fix an annoying bug \nCreate a new branch with a relevant name in your local git repository. \nOnce you have made your changes commit them in your local git repository. Follow the GNOME guidelines for creating commits. \nBe aware that when you create a commit pre commit is executed to perform checks on the changes. In some cases it does some automatic fixes when this happens make sure those are included in the commit you want to create. \nIn the GitLab UI press the fork button WARNING Make sure to be authenticated otherwise the button won t be avalaible \nAdd the remote git repository you just forked as a remote to your local git repository \ngit remote add yourgitlabusername https gitlab.gnome.org yourgitlabusername pitivi \nPush your branch to your fork with \ngit push yourgitlabusername \nCreate merge request either by the link that shows in the command line after pushing or in the GitLab UI clicking Create merge request in your branch. \n"});
