Most of the time, you assign an issue\nto yourself, work on it until it's fixed, and then you close it.\nInterested users can enable notifications for an existing issue to\nget an email when it's updated. It's also possible to change your\n\"Notification settings\" for\npitivi from the default\n\"Global\" to \"Watch\", to receive notifications for any activity in the\nentire project.\nTo get involved, start with issues tagged\n4. Newcomers.\nIt's best to get in touch with us on our IRC channel #pitivi on\nFreenode, to see if it's still meaningful.\nOnce you decide, assign the issue to yourself in GitLab.\nNext is the fun part where you implement your cool feature, or fix an\nannoying bug:\nCreate a new branch with a relevant name in your local git repository.\nOnce you have made your changes, commit them in your local git\nrepository. Follow the GNOME\nguidelines\nfor creating commits.\nBe aware that when you create a commit, pre-commit is executed to\nperform checks on the changes. In some cases it does some automatic\nfixes â€“ when this happens, make sure those are included in the commit you\nwant to create.\nIn the GitLab UI press the \"fork\"\nbutton (WARNING: Make sure to be authenticated otherwise the button won't be\navailable)\nAdd the remote git repository you just forked as a remote to your local git repository:\ngit remote add yourgitlabusername https://gitlab.gnome.org/yourgitlabusername/pitivi\nPush your branch to your fork with:\ngit push yourgitlabusername\nCreate merge request either by the link that shows in the command line after\npushing or in the GitLab UI clicking \"Create merge request\" in your branch.\n"});
