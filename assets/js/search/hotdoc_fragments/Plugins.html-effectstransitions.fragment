fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "Plugins.html#effectstransitions", "fragment": "Effects Transitions \nThis kind of items represent an exception to the general concept of plugin which are usually meant to be singletons by definition only a single object for each plugin is created by the application since they re made to be applied more than one time over the timeline. \nEffects Transitions are collected and exposed to the user as a list grouped into functional categories. This task will be accomplished by a specialized SourceProvider plugin called Effect Transition Provider exposing entry points where Effects can be inserted. The Provider takes also care of creating a new effect object every time the user drags the effect to the timeline thus implementing the Factory design pattern. \nEvery Effect object life cycle starts in the moment the user drags it into the timeline and ends when its is removed during its lifetime the object stores its custom preferencies in memory while default preferences are stored in the same way of preferences of other plugins. \nDetailed discussion of Effects Transitions architecture will be discussed in a separate design document. \n"});
