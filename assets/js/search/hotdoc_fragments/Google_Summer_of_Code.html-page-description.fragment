If we accept your project proposal in June July August you work on your project while being payed by Google. Mid term and end term we evaluate your work. \nOn the technical side it might interest you that we use GES GStreamer as backend GTK for the UI the Meson build system and Flatpak to make builds for users. Flatpak also allows us to have a sandboxed development which means it s very easy to setup you are set up in no time and you don t have to run a virtual machine or f k up your system to be able to build the latest GStreamer and Pitivi. See the section at the top of the contributing page for details why Pitivi is important. \nWhile a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences you can get you need to consider it as professional work \nSince our official policy is to ignore theoretical applications to be eligible you must have gotten involved early on and made at least one contribution prior to applying. Read more about our stance in this blog post Applying for a GSoC project is all about early involvement and commitment If you are interested the best thing you can do is to come to our IRC channel now to make sure we have enough time to get to know you. \nWe are looking for smart and talented developers interested in multimedia and video editing. \nYou need to be highly communicative. Stuck on a problem We need to know. Achieved a milestone or solved a really nasty problem The entire world needs to know. We require to see you in our IRC channel that s where you can meet the team where you follow what s going on and that s where we ll communicate. Email is not sufficient. If you re new to IRC check out IRCCloud and riot.im \nYou must have experience with Python or C depending on your project. Knowledge of Git GStreamer and related technologies is a plus. Familiarity with Test Driven Development is a plus. \nYou have a fantastic learning opportunity to play with technologies such as GStreamer GTK Python etc. We ll direct you to make great use of the tight knit GStreamer and GTK communities so you have high quality feedback throughout your project. \nYou can improve the lives of thousands of users by working on a tangible and fun project. \nYou have the opportunity to present your accomplishments to others at GUADEC where you can also meet with us. In past years the travel expenses for GSoC students have been covered by GNOME. \nSee more reasons for contributing. \n\nYou don t have to be a veteran hacker but it is important that you prove to us and to yourself that you know what you re getting into and that you can handle it. You need to demonstrate that you have sufficient technical skills motivation and have some familiarity with the application and its source code. This also ensures that you get to know members of the community and have sufficient time and information to properly plan your project. \nSee also our official stance as of on the matter and Lionel Dricot s blog post on Being selected as a Summer of Code student \nTherefore you should proceed like this \nPitivi is a very modular video editor whose architecture heavily depends on technologies like GES and GStreamer. The scope of your GSoC project will probably cover only Pitivi but it could very well span multiple codebases \nWe d love to see GSoC proposals originating from an itch you need to scratch. You are welcome to ask around and bring your own ideas. If you re not sure where you can be most useful have a look at the large tasks in the Pitivi tasks for newcomers list. They are fun cool features very suitable for a GSoC project. See the roadmap for our overall vision for the project. Deadlines for applying are approaching fast hurry up \nSee Past GSoCs for details on what the previous GSoC students did. \n"});
