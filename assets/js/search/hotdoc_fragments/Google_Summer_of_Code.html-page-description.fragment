If\nwe accept your project proposal, in June-July-August you work on your\nproject while being payed by Google. Mid-term and end-term we evaluate\nyour work.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, it might interest you that we use GES/GStreamer\nas backend, GTK for the UI, the Meson build system, and Flatpak to make\nbuilds for users. Flatpak also allows us to have a sandboxed development\nwhich means it's very easy to setup, you are set up in no time, and you\ndon't have to run a virtual machine or f**k up your system to be able\nto build the latest GStreamer and Pitivi. See the section at the top of\nthe <a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contributing\">contributing page</a> for details why Pitivi is important.</p>\n<p>While a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences\nyou can get, you need to consider it as <em>professional work</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GSoC projects are on a \u201cfull-time\u201d basis, not \u201cpart-time\u201d</strong>. What\nthis means is that you should not apply if you have some strange\nschedule where, for example, you have school exams for many weeks\nbetween early May and late August. If you have school\nexams/obligations during the summer, <em>you need to mention them</em> and\naccount for them in your schedule.</li>\n<li><strong>No excuses!</strong> We expect you to be a reliable, hard-working person.\nIf things don't go well because for example your roommates are\nnoisy, you don't have air conditioning, or your internet connection\nis unreliable, and you can't fix it, tell us so we can terminate\nyour GSoC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since 2014, our official policy is to ignore \u201ctheoretical\u201d applications\n\u2014 to be eligible, you <strong>must</strong> have gotten involved early-on and made at\nleast one contribution prior to applying.

If you are interested, the best thing you\ncan do is to come to our <a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contact\">IRC channel</a> now, to make sure we have enough\ntime to get to know you.</p>\n<h1 id=\"who-we-are-looking-for\">Who we are looking for</h1>\n<p>We are looking for smart and talented developers interested in\nmultimedia and video editing.</p>\n<p>You need to be highly <strong>communicative</strong>. Stuck on a problem? We need to\nknow. Achieved a milestone or solved a really nasty problem? The <em>entire\nworld</em> needs to know. We require to see you in our IRC channel, that's\nwhere you can meet the team, where you follow what's going on and that's\nwhere we'll communicate. Email is not sufficient. If you're new to IRC,\ncheck out <a href=\"https://www.irccloud.com/pricing\">IRCCloud</a> and <a href=\"https://riot.im/app\">riot.im</a></p>\n<p>You must have experience with Python or C, depending on your project.\nKnowledge of <a href=\"Git.html\">Git</a>, GStreamer and <a href=\"Architecture.html\">related technologies</a> is a plus.\nFamiliarity with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development\">Test-Driven Development</a> is a plus.</p>\n<h1 id=\"what-we-offer\">What we offer</h1>\n<p>You have a fantastic learning opportunity to play with <a href=\"Architecture.html\">technologies</a>\nsuch as GStreamer, GTK+, Python, etc. We'll direct you to make great use\nof the tight-knit GStreamer and GTK communities so you have high-quality\nfeedback throughout your project.</p>\n<p>You can improve the lives of thousands of users by working on a tangible\nand fun project.</p>\n<p>You have the opportunity to present your accomplishments to others at\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Users_And_Developers_European_Conference\">GUADEC</a> where you can also meet with us.

You need to demonstrate that you have sufficient\ntechnical skills, motivation, and have some familiarity with the\napplication and its source code. This also ensures that you get to know\nmembers of the community and have sufficient time and information to\nproperly plan your project.</p>\n<p>See also <a href=\"http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2014/02/15/applying-for-a-gsoc-project-is-all-about-early-involvement-and-commitment/\">our official stance</a> (as of 2014) on the matter and Lionel\nDricot's blog post on \u201c<a href=\"http://ploum.net/be-selected-student-for-soc/\">Being selected as a Summer of Code student</a>\u201d.</p>\n<p>Therefore, you should proceed like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Come to our <a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contact\">IRC channel</a> and stick around.</li>\n<li>Setup your <a href=\"https://github.com/pitivi/pitivi/blob/master/docs/HACKING.md\">development environment</a> and run the <a href=\"Testing.html\">Test suite</a>.\nExplore the development version of Pitivi, what works well and what\ndoesn't, etc. See how you like it.</li>\n<li>To get a better idea of how comfortable you are with the code and\ncommunity, make some small contributions to the code. Pick some\nsmall <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/project/view/15/\">bugs</a> to fix or pick a \u201csmall\u201d task in the <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/tag/pitivi_tasks_for_newcomers/\">Pitivi tasks for\nnewcomers</a> list and have a go at it. Keep us in the loop. The\nearlier you start contributing, the more likely you know what you're\ngetting into. Don't start contributing in March/April: we highly\nencourage you to start getting involved in January/February, or even\nearlier, to have time to try another team if we are not a good fit\nfor you.</li>\n<li>Find a cool feature you need in Pitivi and tell us. Start making a\ndesign doc on how you plan to implement it.</li>\n<li>Fill out the <a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/Students#Fill_out_the_Application\">application</a> and apply officially to the Google's\nSummer of Code <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/\">website</a> under both the GNOME or GStreamer mentoring\norganizations, depending on your project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"project-ideas\">Project ideas</h1>\n<p>Pitivi is a very modular video editor, whose <a href=\"Architecture.html\">architecture</a> heavily\ndepends on technologies like <a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a> and GStreamer. The scope of your GSoC\nproject will probably cover only Pitivi, but it could very well span\nmultiple codebases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/manual/mainwindow.html\">Pitivi</a>, which is the user interface. Written in Python. <em>For those\nwho love design and graphical user interaction.</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a>, the high-level video editing GStreamer library that powers\nPitivi and other applications. Written in C. <em>For those who wish to\nimprove an easy to use, powerful and flexible library for\naudio/video editing.</em></li>\n<li>GStreamer, for low-level work, such as improving filters/effects,\ncodecs, hardware decoding/encoding acceleration, analysis, etc.\nWritten in C. <em>For those seeking a challenging audio and video\nexperience where optimization is key.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'd love to see GSoC proposals originating from an itch you need to\nscratch. You are welcome to ask around and <strong>bring your own ideas</strong>. If\nyou're not sure where you can be most useful, have a look at the \u201clarge\u201d\ntasks in the <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/tag/pitivi_tasks_for_newcomers/\">Pitivi tasks for newcomers</a> list. They are fun cool\nfeatures very suitable for a GSoC project. See the <a href=\"roadmap.md\">roadmap</a> for our\noverall vision for the project. Deadlines for applying are approaching\nfast, hurry up!</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"Past_GSoCs.html\">Past GSoCs</a> for details on what the previous GSoC students did.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
