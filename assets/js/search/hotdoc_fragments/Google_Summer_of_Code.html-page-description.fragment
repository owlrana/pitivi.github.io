If\nwe accept your project proposal, in June-July-August you work on your\nproject while being paid by Google. Mid-term and end-term we evaluate\nyour work.\nSee the section at the top of the contributing page for details why\nPitivi is important.\nWhile a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences\nyou can get, you need to consider it as professional work:\nOur policy is to ignore “theoretical” applications — to be eligible,\nyou must show you're capable. Best is to get involved early-on and\nmake one or more contributions prior to applying. Read more about our stance in\nthis blog post: “Applying for a GSoC project is all about early\ninvolvement and commitment”. If you are interested, the best thing you\ncan do is to come to our IRC channel now, to make sure we have enough\ntime to get to know you.\nWe are looking for smart and talented developers interested in\nmultimedia and video editing.\nYou need to be highly communicative. Stuck on a problem? We need to\nknow. Achieved a milestone or solved a really nasty problem? The entire\nworld needs to know. We require to see you in our IRC channel, that's\nwhere you can meet the team, where you follow what's going on and that's\nwhere we'll communicate. Email is not sufficient. If you're new to IRC,\ncheck out IRCCloud and riot.im.\nYou must have experience with Python or C, depending on your project.\nKnowledge of Git, GStreamer and related technologies is a plus.\nFamiliarity with Test-Driven Development is a plus.\nYou can improve the lives of thousands of users by working on a tangible\nand fun project.\nOn the technical side, it might interest you that we use GES/GStreamer\nas backend, GTK for the UI, the Meson build system, and Flatpak to\ndistribute our own builds to users. You have a fantastic learning\nopportunity to play with these technologies. We'll direct you to make\ngreat use of the tight-knit GStreamer and GTK communities so you have\nhigh-quality feedback throughout your project.\nFlatpak additionally allows us to have a development environment with\nall the dependencies in a sandbox, which is very easy to set up.\nThis means you won't have to mess your system to be able to build\nthe latest GStreamer. Since all of us will be using the same\ndependencies, there will be no friction due to the complex dependencies.\n\nYou don't have to be a veteran hacker but it is important that you prove\nto us — and to yourself — that you know what you're getting into and\nthat you can handle it. You need to demonstrate that you have sufficient\ntechnical skills, motivation, and have some familiarity with the\napplication and its source code. This also ensures that you get to know\nmembers of the community and have sufficient time and information to\nproperly plan your project.\nSee also our official stance (as of 2014) on the matter and Lionel\nDricot's blog post on “Being selected as a Summer of Code student”.\nTherefore, you should proceed like this:\nPitivi is a very modular video editor, whose architecture heavily\ndepends on technologies like GES and GStreamer. The scope of your GSoC\nproject will probably cover only Pitivi, but it could very well span\nmultiple codebases:\nWe'd love to see GSoC proposals originating from an itch you need to\nscratch. You are welcome to ask around and bring your own ideas. If\nyou're not sure where you can be most useful, have a look at our list\nof GSoC project ideas. Deadlines for applying are approaching fast,\nhurry up!\nSee Past GSoCs for details on what the previous GSoC students did.\n\n\nGSoC projects are on a “full-time” basis, not “part-time”. What\nthis means is that you should not apply if you have some strange\nschedule where, for example, you have school exams for many weeks\nbetween early May and late August. If you have school\nexams/obligations during the summer, you need to mention them and\naccount for them in your schedule.\n\nNo excuses! We expect you to be a reliable, hard-working person.\nIf things don't go well because for example your roommates are\nnoisy, you don't have air conditioning, or your internet connection\nis unreliable, and you can't fix it, tell us so we can terminate\nyour GSoC.\n\n\n\nPitivi, which is the user interface. Written in Python. For those\nwho love design and graphical user interaction.\n\n\nGES, the high-level video editing GStreamer library that powers\nPitivi and other applications. Written in C. For those who wish to\nimprove an easy to use, powerful and flexible library for\naudio/video editing.\n\nGStreamer, for low-level work, such as improving filters/effects,\ncodecs, hardware decoding/encoding acceleration, analysis, etc.\nWritten in C. For those seeking a challenging audio and video\nexperience where optimization is key.\n\n\n"});
