To learn about our global mission and how we plan to achieve it read the frontpage of the Pitivi website. You can also take a look at the tour page to find out about cool features. \nThe people of Pitivi have been part of the GStreamer developer community for many years and make sure any issues are solved as quickly as possible in the lower levels in order to avoid any bloated feature at the application level. This is what we call an upstream first approach we fix things everywhere in the software stack see Architecture that we depend on instead of accumulating hacks downstream in our app \nPitivi s Architecture is meant to be uncompromising \nIn the long term we not only aim for Pitivi to be an intuitive video editor for everyone but also a powerful tool for professionals and prosumers. We are not a Windows Movie Maker clone. \nYes and yes. \nWith Pitivi s growing popularity and simple user interface there seems to have been a misunderstanding in its mission many people think our main goal is to make an application for video editing newbies or to make a clone of Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. This is not entirely accurate. We have the following goals \nThe confusion also stems from the common misconception that a powerful application is mutually incompatible with simplicity and efficiency. This is partly because there are so many applications with poorly designed user interfaces and partly because the proprietary software world has conditioned us into thinking that users must be divided in two groups advanced and beginners There is no reason a video editor can t allow complex procedures and make them as easy as possible while being intuitive to learn and efficient to use for basic operations even for amateurs. The reason why there has been such a distinction in the proprietary software world is artificial market segmentation further reading \nExecutive summary \nYou should probably take a look at our Roadmap page for a rough plan of the big picture features we want to tackle soon. Roadmaps are just rough estimates and objectives and since Pitivi is purely a community driven project contributing is the best way to move what matters to you forward \n"});
