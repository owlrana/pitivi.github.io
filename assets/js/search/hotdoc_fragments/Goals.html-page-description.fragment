To learn\nabout our global mission and how we plan to achieve it, read the\nfrontpage of the Pitivi website. You can also take\na look at the tour page to find out about\ncool features.\nThe people of Pitivi have been part of the\nGStreamer developer community for many years and make sure any issues\nare solved as quickly as possible in the lower levels in order to avoid\nany bloated feature at the application level. This is what we call an\n“upstream first” approach: we fix things everywhere in the software\nstack that we depend on,\ninstead of accumulating hacks “downstream” (in our app).\nPitivi's Architecture is meant to be\nuncompromising:\nIn the long term, we not only aim for Pitivi to be an intuitive video\neditor for everyone, but also a powerful tool for professionals and\nprosumers. We are not a Windows Movie Maker clone.\nYes, and yes.\nWith Pitivi's growing popularity and simple user interface, there seems\nto have been a misunderstanding in its mission: many people think our\nmain goal is to make an application for “video editing newbies”, or to\nmake a “clone” of Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. This is not entirely\naccurate. We have the following goals:\nThe confusion also stems from the common misconception that a powerful\napplication is mutually incompatible with simplicity and efficiency.\nThis is partly because there are so many applications with poorly\ndesigned user interfaces, and partly because the proprietary software\nworld has conditioned us into thinking that users must be divided in two\ngroups: “advanced” and “beginners”. There is no reason a video editor\ncan't allow complex procedures (and make them as easy as possible!)\nwhile being intuitive to learn and efficient to use for basic\noperations, even for amateurs. The reason why there has been such a\ndistinction in the proprietary software world is artificial market\nsegmentation (further reading:\n1\n2\n3).\nExecutive summary:\nYou should probably take a look at our Roadmap\npage for a rough plan of the “big picture” features we want to tackle\nsoon. Roadmaps are just rough estimates and objectives, and since Pitivi\nis purely a community-driven project,\ncontributing is the best way to\nmove what matters to you forward!\n\nNo limits on audio/video formats (input/output sizes, resolutions,\nframerates, codecs and container formats, etc.)\nNo limits on the number of tracks/layers used\nNo limits on the number of combined effects\nIntuitiveness for newbies and flexibility for power users (see\nbelow)\nClean separation of the backend and UI. The backend is\nGES and it can be reused by anyone wanting to\ncreate an application on top of it.\netc.\n\n\nMake a powerful, flexible video editor that can appeal to prosumers\nand professionals\nDesign it extremely well. Make its workflow elegant and intuitive.\nIf we succeed, this means we also reach the goal of “making it easy\nfor everyone to use it” possible.\n\n\nWe will make not make a crippled application. In the long run, it\nwill be powerful and flexible. Do not think that “because it doesn't\nhave lots of features right now” means that it was “designed” that\nway. It's just that we need someone to implement those features\nproperly.\nBy designing everything carefully, we strive to keep it simple for\namateurs as well.\n\n"});
