Non-Linear Engine is\nmedia-agnostic and has no notions of video editing. Non-Linear\nEngine is basically composed of a few thread-safe GStreamer plugins\nwhich allow compositing and mixing and translating the project's\ntimeline dynamically into a GStreamer pipeline.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GStreamer\">GStreamer</a>, a multimedia\nframework that allows us to do anything multimedia-related. It is\nvery flexible and uses elements that are packaged in the form of\nplugins. These elements can be codecs/muxers/demuxers/effects, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ultimately, all the components above are based on GLib and communicate\nthrough its signals.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GLib is a low level C library that provides fundamental types and\nalgorithms. It is a base upon which everything is constructed. Since\nwe interact with GStreamer through <a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a>, in Pitivi\nwe can see the GLib basic types (gboolean, gchar, gint, gfloat,\ngdouble etc).</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GObject-2.0\">GObject</a> is a part of\nGLib that provides an object-oriented framework for C.</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
