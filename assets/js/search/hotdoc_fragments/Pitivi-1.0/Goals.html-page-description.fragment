To learn\nabout our global mission and how we plan to achieve it, read the\n<a href=\"http://pitivi.org\">frontpage</a> of the Pitivi website. You can also take\na look at the <a href=\"http://pitivi.org/?go=tour\">tour</a> page to find out about\ncool features.</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"The_people.html\">The people</a> of Pitivi have been part of the\nGStreamer developer community for many years and make sure any issues\nare solved as quickly as possible in the lower levels in order to avoid\nany bloated feature at the application level. This is what we call an\n\u201cupstream first\u201d approach: we fix things everywhere in the software\nstack (see: <a href=\"Architecture.html\">Architecture</a>) that we depend on,\ninstead of accumulating hacks \u201cdownstream\u201d (in our app).</p>\n<p>Pitivi's <a href=\"Architecture.html\">Architecture</a> is meant to be\nuncompromising:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No limits on audio/video formats (input/output sizes, resolutions,\nframerates, codecs and container formats, etc.)</li>\n<li>No limits on the number of tracks/layers used</li>\n<li>No limits on the number of combined effects</li>\n<li>Intuitiveness for newbies and flexibility for power users (see\nbelow)</li>\n<li>Clean separation of the backend and UI. The backend is\n<a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a> and it can be reused by anyone wanting to\ncreate an application on top of it.</li>\n<li>etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the long term, we not only aim for Pitivi to be an intuitive video\neditor for everyone, but also a powerful tool for professionals and\nprosumers. <strong>We are not a Windows Movie Maker clone</strong>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"professional-isnt-this-supposed-to-be-easy-to-use\">\u201cProfessional? Isn't this supposed to be easy to use?\u201d</h1>\n<p><em>Yes</em>, and <em>yes</em>.</p>\n<p>With Pitivi's growing popularity and simple user interface, there seems\nto have been a misunderstanding in its mission: many people think our\nmain goal is to make an application for \u201cvideo editing newbies\u201d, or to\nmake a \u201cclone\u201d of Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. This is not entirely\naccurate. We have the following goals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make a powerful, flexible video editor that can appeal to prosumers\nand professionals</li>\n<li>Design it extremely well. Make its workflow elegant and intuitive.\nIf we succeed, this means we also reach the goal of \u201cmaking it easy\nfor everyone to use it\u201d possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The confusion also stems from the common misconception that a powerful\napplication is mutually incompatible with simplicity and efficiency.\nThis is partly because there are so many <strong>applications with poorly\ndesigned user interfaces</strong>, and partly because the proprietary software\nworld has conditioned us into thinking that users must be divided in two\ngroups: \u201cadvanced\u201d and \u201cbeginners\u201d. There is no reason a video editor\ncan't allow complex procedures (and make them as easy as possible!)\nwhile being intuitive to learn and efficient to use for basic\noperations, even for amateurs. The reason why there has been such a\ndistinction in the proprietary software world is artificial <strong>market\nsegmentation</strong> (further reading:\n<a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/CamelsandRubberDuckies.html\">1</a>\n<a href=\"http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/07/oh-you-wanted-awesome-edition.html\">2</a>\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation\">3</a>).</p>\n<p>Executive summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We will make not make a crippled application. In the long run, it\nwill be powerful and flexible. Do not think that \u201cbecause it doesn't\nhave lots of features right now\u201d means that it was \u201cdesigned\u201d that\nway. It's just that we need someone to implement those features\nproperly.</li>\n<li>By designing everything carefully, we strive to keep it simple for\namateurs as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"yeah-so-whats-your-plan\">Yeah, so what's your plan?</h1>\n<p>You should probably take a look at our <a href=\"Roadmap.html\">Roadmap</a>\npage for a rough plan of the \u201cbig picture\u201d features we want to tackle\nsoon. Roadmaps are just rough estimates and objectives, and since Pitivi\nis purely a community-driven project,\n<a href=\"http://pitivi.org/?go=contributing\">contributing</a> is the best way to\nmove what matters to you forward!</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
