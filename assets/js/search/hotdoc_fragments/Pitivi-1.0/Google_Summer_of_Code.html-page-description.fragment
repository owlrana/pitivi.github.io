If we accept your project proposal, in\nJune-July-August you work on your project while being payed by Google.\nMid-term and end-term we evaluate your work.</p>\n<p>On the technical side, it might interest you that we use GES/GStreamer\nas backend, GTK for the UI, the Meson build system, and Flatpak to make\nbuilds for users. Flatpak also allows us to have a sandboxed development\nwhich means it's very easy to setup, you are set up in no time, and you\ndon't have to run a virtual machine or f**k up your system to be able\nto build the latest GStreamer and Pitivi. See the section at the top of\nthe <a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contributing\">contributing page</a> for\ndetails why Pitivi is important.</p>\n<p>While a GSoC with us is one of the most fun and rewarding experiences\nyou can get, you need to consider it as <em>professional work</em>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>GSoC projects are on a \u201cfull-time\u201d basis, not \u201cpart-time\u201d</strong>. What\nthis means is that you should not apply if you have some strange\nschedule where, for example, you have school exams for many weeks\nbetween early May and late August. If you have school\nexams/obligations during the summer, <em>you need to mention them</em> and\naccount for them in your schedule.</li>\n<li><strong>No excuses!</strong> We expect you to be a reliable, hard-working person.\nIf things don't go well because for example your roommates are\nnoisy, you don't have air conditioning, or your internet connection\nis unreliable, and you can't fix it, tell us so we can terminate\nyour GSoC.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since 2014, our official policy is to ignore \u201ctheoretical\u201d applications\n\u2014 to be eligible, you <strong>must</strong> have gotten involved early-on and made at\nleast one contribution prior to applying.

Stuck on a problem? We need to\nknow. Achieved a milestone or solved a really nasty problem? The <em>entire\nworld</em> needs to know. We require to see you in our IRC channel, that's\nwhere you can meet the team, where you follow what's going on and that's\nwhere we'll communicate. Email is not sufficient. If you're new to IRC,\ncheck out <a href=\"https://www.irccloud.com/pricing\">IRCCloud</a>.</p>\n<p>You must have experience with Python or C, depending on your project.\nKnowledge of <a href=\"Git.html\">Git</a>, GStreamer and <a href=\"Architecture.html\">related\ntechnologies</a> is a plus.

Explore the\ndevelopment version of Pitivi, what works well and what doesn't,\netc. See how you like it.</li>\n<li>To get a better idea of how comfortable you are with the code and\ncommunity, make some small contributions to the code. Pick some\nsmall <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/project/view/15/\">bugs</a>\nto fix or pick a \u201csmall\u201d task in the <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/tag/pitivi_tasks_for_newcomers/\">Pitivi tasks for\nnewcomers</a>\nlist and have a go at it. Keep us in the loop. The earlier you start\ncontributing, the more likely you know what you're getting into.\nDon't start contributing in March/April: we highly encourage you to\nstart getting involved in January/February, or even earlier, to have\ntime to try another team if we are not a good fit for you.</li>\n<li>Find a cool feature you need in Pitivi and tell us. Start making a\ndesign doc on how you plan to implement it.</li>\n<li>Fill out the\n<a href=\"https://wiki.gnome.org/Outreach/SummerOfCode/Students#Fill_out_the_Application\">application</a>\nand apply officially to the Google's Summer of Code\n<a href=\"https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/\">website</a> under\nboth the GNOME or GStreamer mentoring organizations, depending on\nyour project.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1 id=\"project-ideas\">Project ideas</h1>\n<p>Pitivi is a very modular video editor, whose\n[architecture](Architecture.md heavily depends on technologies\nlike <a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a> and GStreamer. The scope of your GSoC project\nwill probably cover only Pitivi, but it could very well span multiple\ncodebases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/manual/mainwindow.html\">Pitivi</a>, which is the\nuser interface. Written in Python. <em>For those who love design and\ngraphical user interaction.</em></li>\n<li><a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a>, the high-level video editing GStreamer\nlibrary that powers Pitivi and other applications. Written in C.\n<em>For those who wish to improve an easy to use, powerful and flexible\nlibrary for audio/video editing.</em></li>\n<li>GStreamer, for low-level work, such as improving filters/effects,\ncodecs, hardware decoding/encoding acceleration, analysis, etc.\nWritten in C. <em>For those seeking a challenging audio and video\nexperience where optimization is key.</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>We'd love to see GSoC proposals originating from an itch you need to\nscratch. You are welcome to ask around and <strong>bring your own ideas</strong>. If\nyou're not sure where you can be most useful, have a look at the \u201clarge\u201d\ntasks in the <a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/tag/pitivi_tasks_for_newcomers/\">Pitivi tasks for\nnewcomers</a>\nlist. They are fun cool features very suitable for a GSoC project. See\nthe <a href=\"roadmap.md\">roadmap</a> for our overall vision for the\nproject.
