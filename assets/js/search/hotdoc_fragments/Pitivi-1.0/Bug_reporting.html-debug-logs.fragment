In loggable.py there are five levels ERROR WARN FIXME INFO DEBUG LOG range As such if you want to see errors and warnings only you launch \nPITIVI_DEBUG bin pitivi \nand if you want to see everything you do \nPITIVI_DEBUG bin pitivi \nIf that s too much and you want to focus on particular parts of the code you can do so. For example you can get output from the Timeline and MediaLibraryWidget classes only \nPITIVI_DEBUG timeline medialibrarywidget bin pitivi \nHere are various examples of commands you can use to generate detailed debug logs that include not only Pitivi s debug output but also GStreamer s \nA basic log can be obtained by running \nPITIVI_DEBUG GST_DEBUG bin pitivi debug.log \nTo get debugging information from Non Linear Engine you could use \nPITIVI_DEBUG GST_DEBUG nle python bin pitivi debug.log \nThe information most likely to be useful would probably be the debug info from GES in addition to Pitivi s \nPITIVI_DEBUG GST_DEBUG ges bin pitivi debug.log \nSome additional tips \n"});
