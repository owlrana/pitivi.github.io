After seeing a comment in this subreddit I decided to give Pitivi a chance and I was blown away. It is not the most feature packed editor kdenlive but it did exactly what I needed it to do I imported video made cuts added transitions added titles and rendered out a min video to ProRes. Not a single glitch in the whole process. Also it looks great If any Pitivi developers are reading THANK YOU You have made a functional video editor under Linux. Looking forward to your release. \ntheray76 on Reddit \nI ve spent years looking for a simple stable video editor to fit into my Linux GNOME desktop experience. Flatpak and Pitivi installation via flapak is simple and it works. Pitivi is a great release. It s stable responsive and it works. Kudos to the Pitivi developers and wider community. if you re like me and you ve been waiting on the sidelines for a simple stable video editor for Linux and in particular the GNOME GTK environment then I recommend you give Pitivi a try. \nmaheart on Reddit \nI have worked as video editor in my earlier life before I became software programmer and used Final Cut Pro. I have always been a Linux user though and have meddled with everything that exist every single year. Cinelerra was always the fall back that would never really let me down because it was frank about its crashers and they were possible to navigate around. \nIn later years I did find Pitivi to be a possible replacement for simple out to blog cuts. Especially the version before they added filters. Sadly the filters version exposed lots of bugs in the underlying stack and everything became dog slow and probably quite unstable. I just stuck with that old now very old version. \nHowever the new GES backed line that is aiming at becoming is something totally different. It is really shaping up to becoming a quite awesome little video editor and I will be donating happily. \nOdin H rthe Omdal on the fundraiser coverage article on OMG Ubuntu February \n"});
