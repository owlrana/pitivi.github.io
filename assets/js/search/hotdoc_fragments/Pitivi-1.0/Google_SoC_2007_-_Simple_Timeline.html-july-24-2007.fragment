I started by examining the patch supplied by Richard Boulton almost a year ago which implemented the complete application logic for handling saving and loading of projects. The patch does not however implement reading and writing of the project file itself. The patch no longer cleanly applies so I did my best to apply it manually. I then created a new patch which I ve uploaded to bugzilla. It s still only a partial patch and it breaks parts of the UI. My goal for the next day or so is to extract the best parts of his design and then implement my own solution. I ll probably use some of his code in the system but will definitely be re implementing the UI. \nPart of the work on implementing file load save support is creating a design document. Edward suggested that I put all my Design Docs up on the Wiki. \n"});
