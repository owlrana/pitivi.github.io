Eggs are similar to java s jar files they make very simple the shipping and installation of new plugins since all you need is to drag the egg file inside the plugins directory. Eggs also ships a standard method for exposing plugin s entry points and dependancies making easy to allow cooperation subordination among plugins. \nwe can expect pitivi to be shipped with some default plugins available for all the users and meant to be uninstalled by the system administrator only while it is also auspicable to let users install custom plugins and encourage them in writing new ones. \nDefault plugins could be placed inside the pitivi installation path i.e usr local pitivi plugins these plugins are usually installed by the linux distribution facility and only users with root privileges can modify them directly. \nUser plugins could be placed inside the user home directory i.e. in home my_user pitivi plugins and can be installed deleted modified by the user. \nPitivi should check for both the locations when searching for available plugins and should use the user home to store plugin configuration parameters i.e home my_user pitivi plugin settings \n"});
