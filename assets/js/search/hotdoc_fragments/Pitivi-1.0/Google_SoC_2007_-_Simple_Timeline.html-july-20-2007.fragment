With edward s help the volume slider on the source widget actually changes the volume for the clip. Today I committed a new revision to the SoC branch which adds a cancel button to the editing widget. This required some internal changes to the editing widget but nothing too serious. Meanwhile Edward is working on making the advanced UI more functional. He s got partial support for moving clips in the advanced timeline but has run afoul of some gstreamer bugs. \nI m considering replacing the slider with a gtk.ScaleButton since that would allow the source widget to shrink down even more while allowing the slider to grow to a more managable size. I m also thinking about a custom widget for seeking that would eventually replace the simple gtk.HScales we ve been using. It feature a much slimmer cursor would support zooming display a timescale provide fancy navigation input such as jog shuttle and would directly show the media start stop points. I m currently trying to design things on paper but maybe i ll post a vector drawing to the wiki for comments. \nProject load save support is in the early stages of design now. We are hoping to have this finished by the end of the summer but it is a major chunk of work. Several contributors have begun submitting patches to help make this task easier. Edward is also beginning to explain to me the intricacies of the effects transition system in pitivi. \n"});
