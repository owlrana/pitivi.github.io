You are in the master branch. \nNote unlike in Bazaar or other DVCSes in git you only do this once the remotes and branches in are all self contained in the repository. In other words you only do one checkout and do everything inside it using branches and remotes. \nYou can see all local branches by using the git branch command. The branch you are working in is marked with an asterisk You can view all branches including the remote ones by doing \ngit branch a \nYou ll notice that it shows you all the branches available from the http git.gnome.org pitivi repository. \nLet s say we add multiple people s remote repositories inside your local repository see Git repositories for the list of our known remotes \ngit remote add nekohayo https github.com nekohayo pitivi.git git remote add thiblahute https github.com thiblahute pitivi.git \nTo update the remotes \ngit remote update \nAnd now you would be able to do stuff like \ngit checkout thiblahute somebranch \nOr to create a new local branch based on that branch \ngit checkout b mynewbranch thiblahute somebranch \ngit remote update does not update your local branches only the remotes. For example if you have a local branch called titles based on nekohayo titles remote branch and the titles branch on the nekohayo remote changed you will have to checkout your local titles branch and update it to reflect the changes with git pull rebase or a git reset hard depending on whether or not you want to keep your local changes \nWhen the remote party has deleted some branches you re still left with local copies of those remote branches... eventually you can clean it up with \ngit remote prune REMOTE_NAME \nI like to think of git checkout like svn switch it allows you to move between branches among other things So to go back to the main branch you do git checkout master \nTypically in Pitivi we use rebase and reset more often than git merge when merging your changes.
