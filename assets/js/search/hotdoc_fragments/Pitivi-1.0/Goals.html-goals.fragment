To learn about our global mission and how we plan to achieve it read the frontpage of the Pitivi website. You can also take a look at the tour page to find out about cool features. \nThe people of Pitivi have been part of the GStreamer developer community for many years and make sure any issues are solved as quickly as possible in the lower levels in order to avoid any bloated feature at the application level.
