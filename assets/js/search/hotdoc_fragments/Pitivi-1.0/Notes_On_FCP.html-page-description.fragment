I have only done some minor editing, and they appear in\nnearly their original form. These are just my observations from viewing\nscreenshots: It is very possible that I have mis-interpreted or missed\nsome important details altogether.</p>\n<p>-Brandon</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-notes\">The Notes</h1>\n<p>there are three kinds of tasks</p>\n<ul>\n<li>acquisition</li>\n<li>editing</li>\n<li>mastering/output</li>\n</ul>\n<p>timeline clips only have name and single thumbnail. single playback head\ndecends from timeline ruler across entire timeline video and audio\ntracks are separated from each other in separate panes.</p>\n<p>each track (audio/video) conatins: enable/disable button, label, lock,\ntwo other unidentified markings. tracks appear slightly translucent,\nwith 3d beveled edges.</p>\n<p>zoom control appears to be logarithmic scale, and is a horizontal\nslider. rather unsightly mix of aqua, carbon, and custom widgets.</p>\n<p>when you import the first clip, final cut asks you if you want to\nconform the project/sequence settings to the clip.</p>\n<p>smoothcam filter (wow)</p>\n<p>filters can be applied to clips in the browser or in the timeline</p>\n<p>some filters need to \u201canalyze\u201d the clip before being used. this data is\nsaved separately from the clip.</p>\n<p>you can normalize audio clips to a peak decibel</p>\n<p>you can make realtime adjustments to filters applied to a clip, but\nthere is also a keyframe editor.</p>\n<p>audio volume is adjustable by manipulating keyframes overlayed on top of\nthe waveform (rendered into the audio clip)</p>\n<p>portions of the timeline can be sent to other studio applications. when\nyou save the project in another studio application, the relevant portion\nof the final cut timeline is updated in place.</p>\n<p>in general apple seems to have broken off pieces of the post production\nworkflow into separate applications that all understand finalcut's file\nformat (and possibly use other mechanisms to communicate)...this might\nbe a UI design choice -- to emphasize the application scope, or it might\nsimply be to help maximize revenues.</p>\n<p>do we have a codec alternative for ProRes 422?</p>\n<p>effects are edited with the \u201ccanvas\u201d window, which presents a clip\nviewer on top, and an editing timeline on the bottom for setting\nkeyframes.</p>\n<p>FCP has stock objects, like colour mattes which can help create title\nkeys, frames, and backdrops.</p>\n<p>FCP allows the use of external title applications</p>\n<p>transitions seem to come before the clips they modify, in line with them\non the same track. not yet clear to me whether the visual size of the\ntransition has anything to do with its duration, or whether the visual\nwidth of the modified clip changes (shrinks) in response to the\ntransition's presence.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
