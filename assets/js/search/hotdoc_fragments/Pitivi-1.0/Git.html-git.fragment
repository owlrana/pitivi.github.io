Git allows you to get a checkout with full history of the Pitivi code create your own branches publish those etc... without the need for access to the central repository. \nIndeed one of the very big strengths of a decentralized a.k.a. distributed system is that it is truly open and meritocratic it allows you to do whatever changes you want to your repository request feedback reviews and then request that others pull your changes into the main repository on which others base their work upon. See http youtube.com watch v XpnKHJAok8 t m05s for an explanation of this phenomenon. \nThis page is not meant to be a general tutorial for Git for that see the GNOME Git page the official Git tutorial documentation page and git ready. In this page we will cover some more advanced usage and the specifics of how we use Git in the Pitivi project. This is aimed at people coming from Bazaar or Subversion. \n"});
