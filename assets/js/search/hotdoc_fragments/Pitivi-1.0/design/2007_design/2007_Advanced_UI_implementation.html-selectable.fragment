This is kept strictly separate from Dragable as there is a use case for selectable objects which cannot be moved by the user as well as a use case for dragable objects which should never become part of the current selection. Objects are selected with Select and deslected with Deselect Objects are notified of their selection status through the selected and deselected method calls. \nBeing part of the selection implies that the object represents data that can be manipulated. To this end all Selectable objects provide a core_object property. The list of all selected core objects can be obtained with the getSelectedCoreObjects class method. \nThe current selection is a set of Selectable objects and any command which affects the current selection operates on these objects or the core objects which they represent To facilitate this the interface provides class methods to iterate over all instances of selectable objects in various ways. \n"});
