The selection consists of a set of objects implementing the Selectable interface. \nThe canvas keeps track of whether or not objects are selected. Objects in the timeline always pass pointer events up to their parent group. If an event reaches the root item group a test is performed to determine if the object should be added to the current selection. If this test passes the objects select method is called. \nThe selection also identifies a primary object this is the object with which the user is directly interacting with i.e. the source of the pointer event. Certain operations make the most sense in the context of a single active object. For example if the user selects several sources and then drags one of them this object will be used as a reference point for edge snapping. \nFinally the user is provided with a few tool bar commands which manipulate the selection explicitly. \n"});
