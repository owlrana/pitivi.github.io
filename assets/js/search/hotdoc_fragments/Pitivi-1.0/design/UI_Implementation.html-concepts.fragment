Existing video editors use the term track to refer to a UI object which represents a stream of video with a sequence of sources. PiTiVi refers to this as a composition. The term track in PiTiVi means a separate channel of output for example audio and video are in separate tracks. \nThis is distinguished from the concept of a layer which is directly related to the notion of compositing. Within a track sources have a property called priority which determines what will appear when the play head reaches a given position in the timeline. By default the source with the lowest numerical priority is displayed. Adding effects to a composition enables multiple sources to be composited together. Priority is used to determine which sources will be used by an effect as input. \n"});
