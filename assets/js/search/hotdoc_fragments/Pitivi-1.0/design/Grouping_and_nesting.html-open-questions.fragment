I think that it should be possible to apply such effects and arbitrary operations to a group and that Ungroup should simply be disabled until all modifications to the group are removed. \nShould groups be displayed in the superproject with holes in time where there is an empty time in the subproject timeline or should they simply be continuous Should there be a mode where even more of the internal structure is visible I think that for a first implementation leaving them as continuous in the superproject UI is entirely sufficient and dramatically simpler to implement than the alternatives. \nIs the duration of a group fixed or variable If it is fixed then we will need some UI to indicate a timeline of fixed duration in the subproject editor If it is variable then what happens when the user uses the subproject editor to make the contents of the group longer Should it expand in the super project or should excess time be ignored. I think excess time should be ignored with duration controlled exclusively from the super project. Ideally it should be possible to modify duration and start point non destructively from the super project and the subproject editor UI should indicate which portions of its timeline are actually in use in the super project. \nShould it be possible to copy a group by reference or only by value i.e. can there exist multiple objects in a timeline that refer to the same subproject I think copy by reference is too valuable to give up but careful UI design will be required to avoid creating massive confusion. A unique name for each subproject displayed in every superproject timeline object that references it might help. \n"});
