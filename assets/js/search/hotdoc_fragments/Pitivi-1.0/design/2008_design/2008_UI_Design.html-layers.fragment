Layers are priority levels within a track. For audio all layers within a track are mixed together into a single stream. For video all sources within a track are composited together in a single stream. The layer position determines the order in which videos are composited with the visually topmost layer appearing as the top most source in the stream. \nimages glayer_addition.png The user can add layers to a given track by dragging the track s separator bar downward. Similarly the user can remove tracks by dragging the layer s separator bar upward however removal of the bottom layer will only be permitted if the layer is empty. Objects within layers can be stacked arbitrarily. This is particularly useful for effects which operate lower priority objects within the timeline. \n"});
