It s will be most usable when the mapping between an object s properties and their effect on the output is straightforward. For example audio volume our video alpha. The current implementation of the videobox element is a good example of what won t work well with this module a more dedicated UI focused on cropping panning would needed \nA few object properties will be static i.e. they are time invariant These will be displayed as standard GTK Widgets. Other properties are controllable i.e. time varying The user can directly manipulate the interpolation curves for these properties through curve control points objects which we refer to as key frames. A partial prototype of this design is available. \nimages gproperties_curve.png \nThe user can add key frames in two different ways ways \nThe user can delete key frame points in two different ways \nGStreamer supports different interpolation modes but only for the entire curve. Changing the interpolation mode for a single point isn t possible we ll have to write our own interpolation code On the other hand it makes sense to treat interpolation mode as a per point option. For now setting the interpolation mode on a point will simply set the interpolation mode on its parent curve. \n"});
