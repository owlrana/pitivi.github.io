Core objects emit signals which prompt changes in the UI. UI elements wrap core objects to manipulate data which in turn emit signals. The observer pattern allows the user interface to listen for changes in the core without coupling the core to the UI. \nIn core we have our own pure python implementation of signals The user interface depends on pygtk and pygoocanvas both of which are based on GObject. We use receivers to automatically connect appropriate signal handler methods to objects which emit them. \n"});
