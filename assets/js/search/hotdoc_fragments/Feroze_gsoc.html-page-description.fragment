It is bundled with Ubuntu. It is very simple to use but\nlacks a few essential features which, if implemented, would greatly\nexpand its userbase. It would be a major boost for the GStreamer and\nPiTiVi community.\nWhile PiTiVi has many necessary functions, it is lacking in the\nfollowing areas:\nMost users want the output formatted for a specific device or service –\nYouTube, iPod, iPhone, DVD, mobile, etc. Presently, the user would have\nto manually specify the codecs, container and codec settings like\nresolution, frame rate,etc. He would have to either be familiar with the\ncodecs or would have to google it up.\nPresets Suggested : iPod , iPad, PlayStation 3, DVD (NTSC, PAL), HTML5 (\nTheora + Vorbis ), Flash video (for embedding), HD (using mkv -> good\ncompression)\nReference : Rendering Profiles\nUsers should by able to easily upload their videos to YouTube, Vimeo,\nArchive.org and DailyMotion from PiTiVi using their respective APIs\nthrough the intuitive GUI.\nCreate a uploader class to make integrating other video services in the\nfuture easier.\nSupport limitations of each – file size, splitting\nUsers have reported for multiple GUI enhancements. Though they have\nnormal priority, coding it would greatly improve the easy of use\nEasy:\nModerate 1:\nModerate 2:\nFollowing is a breakup of the project goals. Estimated time for each\ntarget is in braces.\nUp to May 23 – Study PiTiVi code. Gain indepth knowledge of GStreamer and codec settings and GooCanvas.\nTarget 1 ( 2-3 weeks ) – Implement Preset Manager for Render\nTarget 2 ( 2 weeks ) – Implement video uploading to YouTube, Vimeo, Archive.org and DailyMotion from GUI\nTarget 3 ( 1 week ) – Code Cleanup – Mid-term Evaluation\nTarget 4 ( 2 weeks ) – Implement Easy GUI enhancements\nTarget 5 ( 2 weeks ) – Implement Moderate 1 GUI enhancements\nTarget 6 ( 2 weeks ) – Implement Moderate 2 GUI enhancements\nTarget 5 ( 1 week ) – Final Code Cleanup and Documentation\nAt midterm, Render profile presets and video uploading service would be\nready\nMy Name is Feroze Naina, and I’m currently doing my B.Eng in Chennai,\nIndia.\nhttps://github.com/feroze/\n"});
