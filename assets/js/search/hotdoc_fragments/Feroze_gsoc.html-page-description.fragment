It is bundled with Ubuntu. It is very simple to use but lacks a few essential features which if implemented would greatly expand its userbase. It would be a major boost for the GStreamer and PiTiVi community. \nWhile PiTiVi has many necessary functions it is lacking in the following areas \nMost users want the output formatted for a specific device or service YouTube iPod iPhone DVD mobile etc. Presently the user would have to manually specify the codecs containter and codec settings like resolution frame rate etc. He would have to either be familiar with the codecs or would have to google it up. \nThe user should just be able to click on the output format and render. This would enable us to expand the userbase to people without much codec knowledge. User can add remove and rename presets and edit codec settings within the render dialog menu. The presets should be stored separately and the user should be able to import and export presets from GUI. Enable us to bundle a default set of rendering and project setting presets \nPresets Suggested iPod iPad PlayStation DVD NTSC PAL HTML5 Theora Vorbis Flash video for embedding HD using mkv gt good compression \nReference http wiki.pitivi.org wiki Rendering_Profiles \nUsers should by able to easily upload their videos to YouTube Vimeo Archive.org and DailyMotion from PiTiVi using their respective APIs through the intuitive GUI. \nCreate a uploader class to make integrating other video services in the future easier. \nSupport limitations of each file size splitting \nUsers have reported for multiple GUI enhancements. Though they have normal priority coding it would greatly improve the easy of use \nEasy \nBug Use current clip s parameter Club with render profile setting Bug Ability to add markers to identify scenes and as a visual reminder in timeline Add with Insert Marker and keyboard shortcut Bug Ask for confirmation before deleting previously rendered file Bug Add the ability to export the image currently seen in the viewer Bug More details in unsaved dialog box Bug Catch encoder exceptions and show in debugger window Bug https bugzilla.gnome.org show_bug.cgi id Custom labeling of clips \nModerate \nBug Vertical timeline markers for every defined duration seconds Bug Implement color correction like white balance using GStreamer GES Bug Hide toolbar timeline in fullscreen \nModerate \nBug Ability to render only selected portion of the timeline Bug Manual layer interface Bug Implement cropping panning zooming for clips Bug Change properties resize time duration of multiple photos at one go. \nFollowing is a breakup of the project goals. Estimated time for each target is in braces. \nUp to May Study PiTiVi code. Gain indepth knowledge of GStreamer and codec settings and GooCanvas. Target weeks Implement Preset Manager for Render Target weeks Implement video uploading to YouTube Vimeo Archive.org and DailyMotion from GUI Target week Code Cleanup Mid term Evaluation Target weeks Implement Easy GUI enhancements Target weeks Implement Moderate GUI enhancements Target weeks Implement Moderate GUI enhancements Target week Final Code Cleanup and Documentation \nAt midterm Render profile presets and video uploading service would be ready \nMy Name is Feroze Naina and I m currently doing my B.Eng in Chennai India. \nhttps github.com feroze \n"});
