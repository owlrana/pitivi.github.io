In this case properties interpolation graphs are overlaid atop source widgets directly. The properties can be shown hidden with the property selection popup at the bottom of the source. In addition the interpolation mode can be set for the currently selected interpolation graph. The interpolation graph is manipulated with keyframes which are dragable handles that adjust the timestamp and keyframe. \n\nThe basic design doesn t address the problem of keyframes in SimpleEffects which don t have room to display interpolation graphs. In this variant the keyframe interpolation graphs have been moved directly below the timeline. Selecting any object or group of objects the color balance effect in this mock up is selected causes its properties to be displayed in the property editing region below. Not shown are the key frame handles which would not become visible until objects within the key frame window are selected. \nAll keyframed properties are initially flat lines. These lines can be moved up or down simply by clicking dragging. \nAt this point it is not yet clear which variant would be preferable. It is also not yet clear how the user will add or remove key frames. Possibilities are \n\nThe similar to the basic design but objects can be expanded to take up a maximal amount of screen space. This extra space is used to display the interpolation graphs. \n\nFeatures in this mockup \n\nI would be a strong proponent in favor of having only one timeline for PiTiVi the advanced one. I mean I really don t think that a multitrack UI like that is harder than the imovie simplified like counterpart. This multitrack interface is scalable from the newbie to the professional if you design think the user interface really well you can leave that to me I believe a direct manipulation multitrack time proportional timeline interface kicks the hell out of the current simplified interface and will need no significant learning curve even for grandma. The rest can be done with nice tutorial screencasts that I would gladly provide and that would give the advantage of not splitting the coding workforce over two timelines. Do one thing and do it so well that grandma s jaw drops not from natural cause Kiddo June BST \n"});
