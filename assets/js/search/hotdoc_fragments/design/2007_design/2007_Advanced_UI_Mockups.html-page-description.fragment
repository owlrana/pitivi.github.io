In this case, properties interpolation graphs are overlaid\natop source widgets directly. The properties can be shown/hidden with\nthe property selection popup at the bottom of the source. In addition,\nthe interpolation mode can be set for the currently selected\ninterpolation graph. The interpolation graph is manipulated with\n“keyframes” which are dragable handles that adjust the timestamp and\nkeyframe.\n\nThe basic design doesn't address the problem of keyframes in\nSimpleEffects, which don't have room to display interpolation graphs. In\nthis variant, the keyframe interpolation graphs have been moved directly\nbelow the timeline. Selecting any object (or group of objects, the\ncolor-balance effect in this mock-up is selected) causes its properties\nto be displayed in the property editing region below. Not shown are the\nkey-frame handles, which would not become visible until objects within\nthe key-frame window are selected.\nAll keyframed properties are initially flat lines. These lines can be\nmoved up or down simply by clicking/dragging.\nAt this point it is not yet clear which variant would be preferable. It\nis also not yet clear how the user will add or remove key-frames.\nPossibilities are:\n\nThe similar to the basic design, but objects can be expanded to take up\na maximal amount of screen space. This extra space is used to display\nthe interpolation graphs.\n\nFeatures in this mockup:\n\nI would be a strong proponent in favor of having only one timeline for\nPiTiVi, the advanced one. I mean, I really don't think that a\nmultitrack UI like that is harder than the “imovie-simplified like”\ncounterpart. This multitrack interface is scalable from the newbie\nto the professional, if you design, think the user interface really\nwell (you can leave that to me ;). I believe a “direct manipulation”\nmultitrack “time-proportional” timeline interface kicks the hell out of\nthe current “simplified interface”, and will need no significant\nlearning curve, even for grandma. The rest can be done with nice\ntutorial screencasts that I would gladly provide, and that would give\nthe advantage of not splitting the coding workforce over two timelines.\nDo one thing, and do it so well that grandma's jaw drops (not from\nnatural cause)! --Kiddo 23:28, 10 June 2007\n(BST)\n\nWhen a source in the timeline moves, the viewer needs to seek just\nbefore that source's in point in the timeline.\nWhen the user adjusts the in-point or out-point of a source, the\nviewer needs to seek to the new in or out point in the source\nWhen the user adjusts a keyframe, the viewer needs to seek to that\npoint in the timeline and show the user a preview of the change\n\n\nclick directly on the graph and a new keyframe appears if one hasn't\nbeen created (means that the line as a whole isn't movable. have to\nselect both end-points)\nselect a keyfame then click “add” (user can't control where new\nframe is added, so a second adjustment step is required)\n\n\nnice looking clips representation on the timeline, maybe in cairo?\narrows on the left and right sides of the clips to allow setting the\nbeginning/end (only works in the advanced timeline, because the\nclips' widths are proportional to their duration). If the user zooms\nout or the clip is too short, these arrows should “squeeze”\nthemselves, and, below a certain threshold, disappear completely.\nThe user will still be able to manipulate the begin/end points by\ndragging the sides (borders) of the clip.\nthumbnails displayed when enough space is available and when the\nuser has not deactivated them in the preferences\n\nnotice how the proportions of the various components of the UI are\ndifferent from the simple timeline. Here, the video preview and\nmedia library are smaller, pushed to the top, to leave a lot more\nspace for the timeline itself. In a multitrack non-linear editor,\nyou want the timeline to be the main zone of interaction and\nmaximize the amount of space you have to play with it\nwaveform previews for audio, ripped straight out of\nJokosher\n\nthe layer buttons on the left are there just for making the mockup\nlook less empty, they should be replaced by relevant ones\nnotice the transition indicators on the bottom clip and the\ntop-right clip: some white “curve” allows you to see the speed of\ntransitions such as crossfades and fade-in/out\nthe clip displayed on the layer “bg actors” has a motion curve (the\nthing called “velocity curve” in Vegas Video). You might want to\nlook at Jokosher's code that was used for their audio volume curves,\nit would be great to be able to control the volume/opacity/speed of\nan audio/video clip using curves everywhere as “keyframes”.\nthis user interface's audio and video tracks are separated. Do\nnot be fooled by the looks. It was just me being lazy (and\nforgetting to show audio tracks everywhere). Basically, what you are\nseeing in this mockup is a bunch of “silent clips with no audio” (or\nclips whose audio tracks were removed in favor of one sound track)\n“pyrotechs” and “bg actors” are just track “names” (or “labels”)\nthis was made from a screenshot of the French version of pitivi, so\na few terms might seem odd. For example “Piste vidéo” means “Video\ntrack”.\nthis whole timeline is *HUGE*. This would be in a case where the\nuser has big toolbars in his gnome preferences, and where he\nstretched up the layer's height (because, realistically, the layer\nheights should be maybe ½ of that to avoid eating up too much screen\nheight).\n\n"});
