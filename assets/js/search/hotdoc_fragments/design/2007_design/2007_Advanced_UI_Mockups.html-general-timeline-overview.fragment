I mean I really don t think that a multitrack UI like that is harder than the imovie simplified like counterpart. This multitrack interface is scalable from the newbie to the professional if you design think the user interface really well you can leave that to me I believe a direct manipulation multitrack time proportional timeline interface kicks the hell out of the current simplified interface and will need no significant learning curve even for grandma. The rest can be done with nice tutorial screencasts that I would gladly provide and that would give the advantage of not splitting the coding workforce over two timelines. Do one thing and do it so well that grandma s jaw drops not from natural cause Kiddo June BST \n"});
