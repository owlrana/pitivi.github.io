Also, you might be interested to see the\nAdvanced UI Mockups.\nMedias can be added to the source list by several means:\n\nThe medias are all shown with an icon and some details in the source\nlist\n\nThe user selects the desired scene from the source list and drags it\nonto the timeline\n\nThe dropped scene appears on the timeline.\nAll scenes are colour-coded (random colours) so that you can easily see\nin the timeline slider where you sources are. Here, the scene is\ncoloured in green, and it takes up the whole timeline.\nAlso notice that the new scene is automatically selected, this is\nvisible here because it is highlighted in red both in the timeline\nslider and in the simple timeline.\n\n\nJust like for the first scene, the new scene is added, with a colour\ncode, and you can see in the timeline slider that it takes up more room\nthan the first one since it is longer.\nA transition is automatically added between new scenes and existing\nones. This is a sensible default choice, since hard-transitions are\nreally ugly to look at. The default choice is a fade transition that\ntakes 1 second.\n\nTo remove a scene, just press on the cross/delete button at the top\nright of the scene.\n\nThese are the various steps for editing a scene, that is : modify the\nstart/stop duration of a scene.\nTo edit a scene, you need to activate the editing mode for that video.\nYou can do so by clicking on the Edit button (highlighted in red in\nthe mockup below).\n\nOnce in editing mode, the scene takes all the width of the timeline, and\nthe timeline slider shows which source is selected by highlighting it in\nred.\nThe two viewers at the left and right of the editing view represent the\nstart and stop position of the scene. The three buttons below each\nviewers are:\nThe editing slider represents the whole scene, with the position of the\nstart/stop points.\n\nUsing the editing slider, it is possible to seek through the scene to\nfind the adequate start/stop points. Notice that the position is\nsynchronous with the position in the timeline slider.\n\nOnce the user has chosen where the scene should start, you can click on\nthe 'set start point' button. The editing slider will represent the\nstart point by graying out everything before that point.\nThe width of the scene also changes in the timeline slider (FIXME : this\nshould be visible here, and not in the following mockup).\n\nIn the same way we did previously, we can seek through the editing\nslider to find an adequate stop position.\n\nPressing the 'set stop position' (highlighted in red below) will mark\nthe stop position on the editing slider by graying out everything after\nthat position.\nThe duration in the timeline slider will also be changed to show the\nmodification (FIXME: It is in fact only visible on the following mockup)\n\nTo leave the editing mode, simply press the Done button (highlited\nin red below).\n\nThe scene has shrunk back to the normal size.\n\nTo apply an effect on a scene, select one from the effect list and drag\nit onto a scene.\n\nOnce added, the effect will appear in the scene's effect slot.\n\nTo remove an effect, click on the remove button in the effect slot\n(shown in red below).\n\nTo add a transition between two scenes, select one from the transitions\nlist and drag it between two scenes.\n\nOnce added, it will appear between the two scenes in the timeline.\n\nTo modify a transition, select one from the transitions list and drop it\nonto an existing transition...\n\n... and voila\n\nTo remove an existing transition, click on the cross/delete button at\nthe top-right of the transition (highlighted in red).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nclicking on the 'Add Media' button (shown in mockup below)\nDragging from desktop, nautilus, or anything supporting the uri-list\nDND protocol\n\n\n-/+ to move the stop/start position forward or backward by one frame\na button to set the current position in the editing slider to the\nstart/stop position.\n\n"});
