Also you might be interested to see Advanced_UI_Mockups. \nMedias can be added to the source list by several means \n\nThe medias are all shown with an icon and some details in the source list \n\nThe user selects the desired scene from the source list and drags it onto the timeline \n\nThe dropped scene appears on the timeline. \nAll scenes are colour coded random colours so that you can easily see in the timeline slider where you sources are. Here the scene is coloured in green and it takes up the whole timeline. \nAlso notice that the new scene is automatically selected this is visible here because it is highlighted in red both in the timeline slider and in the simple timeline. \n\n\nJust like for the first scene the new scene is added with a colour code and you can see in the timeline slider that it takes up more room than the first one since it is longer. \nA transition is automatically added between new scenes and existing ones. This is a sensible default choice since hard transitions are really ugly to look at. The default choice is a fade transition that takes second. \n\nTo remove a scene just press on the cross delete button at the top right of the scene. \n\nThese are the various steps for editing a scene that is modify the start stop duration of a scene. \nTo edit a scene you need to activate the editing mode for that video. You can do so by clicking on the Edit button highlighted in red in the mockup below \n\nOnce in editing mode the scene takes all the width of the timeline and the timeline slider shows which source is selected by highlighting it in red. \nThe two viewers at the left and right of the editing view represent the start and stop position of the scene. The three buttons below each viewers are \nThe editing slider represents the whole scene with the position of the start stop points. \n\nUsing the editing slider it is possible to seek through the scene to find the adequate start stop points. Notice that the position is synchronous with the position in the timeline slider. \n\nOnce the user has chosen where the scene should start you can click on the set start point button. The editing slider will represent the start point by graying out everything before that point. \nThe width of the scene also changes in the timeline slider FIXME this should be visible here and not in the following mockup \n\nIn the same way we did previously we can seek through the editing slider to find an adequate stop position. \n\nPressing the set stop position highlighted in red below will mark the stop position on the editing slider by graying out everything after that position. \nThe duration in the timeline slider will also be changed to show the modification FIXME It is in fact only visible on the following mockup \n\nTo leave the editing mode simply press the Done button highlited in red below \n\nThe scene has shrinked back to the normal size. \n\nTo apply an effect on a scene select one from the effect list and drag it onto a scene. \n\nOnce added the effect will appear in the scene s effect slot. \n\nTo remove an effect click on the remove button in the effect slot shown in red below \n\nTo add a transition between two scenes select one from the transitions list and drag it between two scenes. \n\nOnce added it will appear between the two scenes in the timeline. \n\nTo modify a transition select one from the transitions list and drop it onto an existing transition... \n\nand voila \n\nTo remove an existing transition click on the cross delete button at the top right of the transition hightlighted in red \n\n\n\n\n"});
