Some of this design has been implemented in the _SOC_BLEWIS branch and these changes will be gradually merged into trunk. \nThe goal of the design is to build a UI which supports the following features \nIt is important to distinguish between a track and a layer in application terminology. Existing video editors use the term track to refer to a UI object which represents a stream of video with a sequence of sources. PiTiVi refers to this as a composition. The term track in PiTiVi means a separate channel of output for example audio and video are in separate tracks. The Timeline class contains one TimelineComposition for each of its output tracks. Currently these are hard coded to audiocomp and videocomp but in the future multiple audio and video output tracks will be supported. This will enable things like multi language sound tracks or multi angle video sequences. \nThis is distinguished from the concept of a layer which is directly related to the notion of compositing. Within a track sources have a property called priority which determines what will appear when the play head reaches a given position in the timeline. By default the source with the lowest numerical priority is displayed. Adding effects to a composition enables multiple sources to be composited together. Priority is used to determine which sources will be used by an effect as input. \n"});
