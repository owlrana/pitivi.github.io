fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/Grouping_and_nesting.html#internal-recursion", "fragment": "Internal Recursion \nTo provide more advanced functionality we will require recursion that is not opaque to the Pitivi user interface. In Pitivi source clips are immutable and this invariant seems worth preserving for the sake of predictable behavior. Therefore if groups are to be editable and distinct from ordinary clips they should not be implemented via the standard clip mechanism as described above. \nTo allow the user interface to behave differently for groups than for individual clips while still preserving a simple recursive structure one solution is to have entire Pitivi sub projects defined within a single project file and inserted into the timeline as a timeline object. Then the group action generates a subproject equivalent to the selected items deletes those items from the timeline and adds the subproject object to the timeline in their place. Ungroup does the reverse. \n"});
