Is a D animator working for a gaming company so his editing needs are somewhat different than the average videographer or editor. His duties include producing high quality stills and shorts for promotional purposes as well as in game cinematics ICG Most of his sequences are pre rendered and brought in as sequenced images. In general the sequences are rendered to their finished length and only occasionally are the sequences trimmed down. \nAfter lunch with M he showed me how he performed simple editing tasks in Adobe Premiere. He discussed how Premiere differed from its alternatives. For comparison he also performed similar tasks in After Effects. He commented that Premiere doesn t focus on individual frames. After Effects is much more focused on frame accurate editing and keyframing. M. said that he actually preferred using After Effects for most editing tasks. He also showed me how Maya handles animation through two separate interfaces the dope sheet and the graph. The dope sheet hearkens back to traditional D animation as a means of timing lip movements to speech sounds. The property graph directly displays the mathematics of a property as they change over time. \n"});
