Sources are clips which provide data. Effects are filters which consume lower priority clips as input and produce filtered output. \nBoth Source and effect objects have properties. All properties can be manipulated via the property browser but some of properties like audio volume or video alpha will be so commonly used that they are embedded directly onto the widget. These embedded interpolation curves are manipulated in exactly the same way as interpolation curves in the property editor see the Default Property Editor section for more info. \n"});
