The Viewer,\nTimeline, Clip Library, and Clip Editor, and Effect Library can be\ndetached from the main window by clicking a special “detach” button.\nThese windows appear as normal top-level windows. When the user closes\none of these windows, the component returns to its default location. In\naddition, the clip editor and viewer can be “expanded” so that they\ncompletely fill their parent windows.\n\nWhen the mouse moves over a selectable item, it becomes highlighted to\nindicate its focus.\n\nSingle-clicking on items sets the selection to that item. Selection is\nindicated by more prominent highlighting.\nWhatever the method used, selection is an undoable action.\n \nClick and drag on blank canvas activates selection marquee. While\ndragging the selection marquee, objects that will be selected when the\nmouse-button is released indicate focus. It is clear which objects\ntouched by the marquee will be selected.\n\nSome tool-bar commands to modify selection. These are track-wise\noperations. The operation will be performed for each track which\ncontains a selected clip. These operations to not apply to selections of\nkey-frame points within clips, but they do apply to timeline and\ntrack-level markers.\n\n“Select before” -- select everything between the start of the project\nand the current selection\n\n“Select After” -- select everything between the end of the project and\nthe current selection\n\n“Select Above” -- select everything between the top-most layer and the\ncurrent selection\n\n“Select Below”\n\n“Select Entire Layer” -- selects everything else in the layer(s) of the\ncurrently selected source(s)\n\n“Select Entire Track” -- selects everything else in the track(s) of the\ncurrently selected source(s)\n\n“Select None” -- remove all items from the current selection\n\n“Select All” -- select the entire project\nUsed for playing back video from a variety of sources, primarily the\ntimeline. Provides basic playback controls, as well as single-frame\nforward / rewind.\nDuring certain edit operations, the it would be useful if the viewer\ncould show visual feedback of the edit in progress. After operation\nends, viewer returns to previous state.\nThe user can lock the viewer into a continuous loop over a portion of\nthe timeline. In this case, all other seeking behavior is disabled. The\nuser can make continuous adjustments while the loop plays.\n\nThe primary component of the UI. This is where the user directly\nmanipulates sources and effects which will appear in the final output.\nIt is a time-proportional representation of the edit decision list.\nClips appear as horizontal rectangles, their with proportional to their\nduration, and their position along the x axis proportional to the time\nat which they start. The metaphor is of virtual strips of film. The user\ncan “cut” (meaning split), move, resize, and group (splice?) these\nstrips.\n\nThe timeline is subdivided into tracks. Tracks represent separate\noutput channels with a single media type. Within a track, all objects\nhave the same media type, and there is at least one track in the\ntimeline for every type of media that the timeline contains. The user\ndoes not add or remove tracks directly: the user adds objects to the\ntimeline, and tracks are created as appropriate. Most projects will only\nhave one audio and one video track.\nTracks can be expanded or contracted. Expanded tracks stack their clips\nvertically, according to the clips' layer position (priority). When a\ntrack is collapsed, all sources appear at the same vertical position, as\nif contained within a single layer. This single layer can then be\nfurther collapsed.\nTracks are themselves subdivided into layers. Layers are priority levels\nwithin a track. For audio, all layers within a track are mixed together\ninto a single stream. For video, all sources within a track are\ncomposited together in a single stream. The layer position determines\nthe order in which videos are composited, with the visually topmost\nlayer appearing as the top-most source in the stream.\n The user can add layers to a given track by\ndragging the track's separator bar downward. Similarly, the user can\nremove tracks by dragging the layer's separator bar upward; however,\nremoval of the bottom layer will only be permitted if the layer is\nempty. Objects within layers can be stacked arbitrarily. This is\nparticularly useful for effects, which operate lower-priority objects\nwithin the timeline.\n\nOrdinarily, layers take up a fair amount of space. This is to make room\nfor thumbnails, waveforms, and keyframes.\n\nLayers and tracks can be contracted to save space. The user can contract\na layer by clicking their expander widgets on the far left side of the\ntimeline.\n\nThis can also be done for entire tracks\n\nSources and effects (within a track) are content streams of a single\nmedia type. Sources are clips which provide data. Effects are filters\nwhich consume lower priority clips as input and produce filtered output.\nBoth Source and effect objects have properties. All properties can be\nmanipulated via the property browser, but some of properties, like audio\nvolume or video alpha, will be so commonly used that they are embedded\ndirectly onto the widget. These “embedded” interpolation curves are\nmanipulated in exactly the same way as interpolation curves in the\nproperty editor (see the Default Property Editor section) for more info.\nObjects in the timeline can move in both horizontal and vertical axis.\nThe semantics, however, change depending on the type of object. For all\nobjects, the horizontal (x) axis is interpreted as the time axis. For\nsources an effects, the vertical (y) axis the source's layer position\nwithin a track (tracks are shown visually stacked, but moving a source\nbetween tracks is accomplished through a different mechanism).\nAll objects have edge snapping enabled during horizontal motion. At this\npoint, we believe this is the most common use case. This edge snapping\neffect is intended to be subtle, with a deaband of only a few pixels.\n\nObjects in the timeline can be temporarily deactivated. The deactivate\ncommand is in found in the timeline toolbar, and will deactivate\nwhatever objects are in the current selection. The reactivate command\nundoes this operation.\nAn entire track can also be suppressed. To do this, click the disable\ntoggle near the track's name on the left side of the timeline.\n The user chooses the clip from the clip browser by\nclicking and dragging.\n When the object enters the timeline, the timeline\nresponds by showing how the timeline will change. In this case the clip\nhas both audio and video streams, so objects appear in both audio and\nvideo tracks.\n The user can move objects to desired layers and\ntime offsets.\n By holding the appropriate modifier key, the user\ncan push existing objects out of the way...\n ...or add a source into a new layer.\nEffects can be dropped into the timeline in almost exactly the same way\nas clips. The main difference is that effects come from the effects\nlibrary.\n User selects the effects library from the tab.\n When adding effects into a new layer, the layer\nis initially collapsed.\nTrimming a clip is always possible by clicking/dragging on source\ntrimming handles. By default, the in or out point of a clip should be\nedge-snapped (so that it is easy to put the clip back the way it was).\nThe UI should constrain the setting of in/out point so that sources\ncan't be stretched beyond maximum native duration. clicking and\ndragging a trimming handle should not change the current selection\n\nFirst, the user moves the mouse over the desired clip's trimming handle\n\nThe cursor changes to a left- or right-edge trimming cursor.\n\nClick-and drag sets the in or out point of the clip as appropriate.\nA variant of trimming, which works when two clips are adjacent in the\nsame layer. Sets the in-point of the left clip an the out-point of the\nright clip, keeping the total duration of both sources the constant.\nRoll edits are activated by holding the appropriate modifier key while\ndragging a trimming handle. Note that this is only expected to work when\nit is possible to set the in/out points of both sources to the same\npoint in time.\n\nFirst the user places the mouse over the appropriate trimming handle.\n\nThe user holds down the appropriate modifier key. Cursor changes from\ntrimming to roll-edit cursor.\n\nWhen the user drags the mouse, the edit points are set as appropriate.\n\nHowever, if the user releases the roll-edit modifier key, the edit\nreverts to the default trimming operation.\nThis is another variant on basic trimming. The source who's trimming\nhandle is being manipulated is trimmed as usual, however the adjacent\nsource(s) are rightward in the appropriate direction, so that the\ntrimming does not create a gap between the sources. This shifting\ncarries down the entire length of the track, keeping sources in the same\nrelative position.\n\nUser places cursor over the desired source's trimming handle.\n\nUser holds the appropriate modifier key. Cursor changes to ripple cursor\n\nUser drags the the mouse. Adjacent sources are shifted.\n\nThe user can also hold an additional modifier key to make the ripple\nedit work across multiple layers.\nIf the user releases the ripple-edit modifier key, the edit reverts to\nthe default trimming operation.\nAnother variant on basic trimming. The source's in/out points are not\nset as normal, but rather the source keeps the same in/out points and\nthe source is sped up or slowed down to accommodate the new duration.\nTimestretch only applies to sources of finite length, such as files.\nThere are two methods of combining timeline objects together: linking\nand grouping. Linking allows the user to keep distinct timeline objects\nsynchronized. Moving one object causes all of its linked “sibling”\nobjects to move. The relative offset between siblings is preserved.\n \nSome clips will be linked by default (for example, audio and video from\nthe same file).\n \nBut the user can link arbitrary objects together as well.\nTo link objects:\nTo unlink objects:\nGrouping is similar to linking in that multiple objects are combined,\nbut different in that the resulting group is treated as a single object.\nThe user can make multiple “clones” of a single “master”, and changes to\nthe master will ripple out to each of the clones. Unlike linking,\ngrouping creates a new “clip” in the Clip Library. Effects applied to\nthe group apply to the output of the group as a whole, rather than the\ntopmost object in the group.\n \nTo group objects:\nTo ungroup objects:\nTODO: how will we edit the groups? Two approaches: recursive editing, or\n“expanding” in place. What are the pros and cons of each? Other issues:\nfull, partial, or no synchronization of clones.\n\nContains a list of all the clips in the project. The user can drag\nexternal files onto this component to add them to the project (an import\ntool bar command also works. The user adds clips to the Timeline by\ndragging them them from the Clip Library and dropping them onto the\nTimeline.\nThe Clip Library also provides commands to manipulate the clips in the\nproject:\nSharing the same tab view as the source browser is the property editor.\nWhile the timeline is meant to provide a film-strip metaphor, the\nproperty interface allows the user to change the more abstract\nproperties of the currently selected timeline object(s) (for example,\naudio balance, or image color correction). The type of controls\npresented are determined by the current selection:\n\nGoals\nFeatures The default editor lets you set all of the otherwise hidden\nproperties of an object. It's will be most usable when the mapping\nbetween an object's properties and their effect on the output is\nstraightforward. For example, audio volume, our video alpha. The current\nimplementation of the videobox element is a good example of what won't\nwork well with this module (a more dedicated UI focused on\ncropping/panning would needed).\nA few object properties will be static (i.e. they are time invariant).\nThese will be displayed as standard GTK+ Widgets. Other properties are\n“controllable” (i.e. time-varying). The user can directly manipulate the\ninterpolation curves for these properties through curve control points\nobjects, which we refer to as “key-frames.” A partial\nprototype of this design is available.\n\nThe user can add key-frames in two different ways ways:\nThe user can delete key-frame points in two different ways:\nGStreamer supports different interpolation modes, but only for the\nentire curve. Changing the interpolation mode for a single point isn't\npossible (we'll have to write our own interpolation code). On the other\nhand, it makes sense to treat interpolation mode as a per-point option.\nFor now setting the interpolation mode on a point will simply set the\ninterpolation mode on its parent curve.\nThe user can add still images to the timeline. By default the image is\nletterboxed to the current project resolution, but these defaults can be\nchanged to suit the users's needs.\n First the user selects the image in the\ntimeline\n The image property editor appears in the\nproperty browser.\n The user can crop the image to an arbitrary\nregion.\n\n The user can scale the image as appropriate.\n The user can also set the orientation of the\nimage.\nNEEDS WORK\nSpecify sets of pictures which will be displayed in sequence:\nOther Ideas:\nNEEDS WORK\nFor the “motion transform” effect object (yet to be implemented)\nNeeds to support the following properties over time\nAlso need to be able to set the color and/or alpha of the “background”.\nIdeas...parametric curves on a 2-d plane?

Using the viewer would be better.\nThe title card editor might look something like this.\n\nThe effect library lists all of the available effects, whether delivered\nthrough plug-ins or internal to PiTiVi. The user can drag-and-drop\neffects into the timeline in the same way they can with clips.\nProvides application-level commands:\nFlush with the edge of the screen in full-screen mode, for easy access\nto commands.\nFinally, there is one modal tool -- the split tool -- which splits a\nclip or effect object into two segments.\nZooming Controls:\nProvides a list of commands which operate on the current selection.\nIn addition, other commands will appear or become sensitive depending on\ncontext - i.e. the current selection.\nWhen one or more curves is in the selection:\nThis is a list of every imaginable setting that could possibly go in\nthere.
