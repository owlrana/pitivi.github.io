Tracks represent separate output channels with a single media type. Within a track all objects have the same media type and there is at least one track in the timeline for every type of media that the timeline contains. The user does not add or remove tracks directly the user adds objects to the timeline and tracks are created as appropriate. Most projects will only have one audio and one video track. \nTracks can be expanded or contracted. Expanded tracks stack their clips vertically according to the clips layer position priority When a track is collapsed all sources appear at the same vertical position as if contained within a single layer. This single layer can then be further collapsed. \n"});
