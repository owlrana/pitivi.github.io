The UI can then decide whether to listen to events modifications taking place on the overall Timeline or on the individual Tracks. \nThis allows both creating simple and complex UI while offering the same interfaces \nAll of the following editing actions must be done on the Timeline TimelineObject s or TimelineSelections and not on the Track s or TrackObject s \ntracks Ordered list of Tracks controlled by the Timeline selections List of TimelineSelection in use. objects Ordered list of TimelineObject controlled by the Timeline.

But the last TimelineObject only controls a TrackObject in the first Track. \nEach TrackObject of a given TimelineObject can have a relative offset \nThis can be seen with the nd TimelineObject where the TrackObject it controls in the second track doesn t start at the same position. \n\nThe following diagram shows the relationship between \n\nWith the diagram above the use case of adding a source file to a Timeline becomes trivial \nThe Timeline creates a TimelineObject compatible with the given ObjectFactory type \nTimelines can therefore reject incompatible ObjectFactory like Live devices \nThe timeline looks for what Streams the ObjectFactory can consume provide \nFor each of the Streams that the ObjectFactory handles \nFind a Track with a compatible Stream \nThe user can of course choose his own Stream Track mapping \nCreate a TrackObject for that ObjectFactory Stream \nAdd the TrackObject to the Track \nLink the TrackObject to the newly created TimelineObject \nThe following diagram shows \nThe links between TrackObject s and GnlObject s show their relationship. \n\nWe have a TimelineObject X controlling two TrackObject A and B coming from a common ObjectFactory O This is the most common case when adding a Audio Video File to the Timeline. \nWe want to handle the TrackObject s separately. Maybe to offset them maybe to remove one of the TrackObject \n\nThis is the case when we had two TrackObjects originally belonging to the same TimelineObject but which we unlinked. \n\nThis is for the more generic case of linking two TrackObjects. A common example is when we recorded Audio and Video on separate devices files. \n"});
