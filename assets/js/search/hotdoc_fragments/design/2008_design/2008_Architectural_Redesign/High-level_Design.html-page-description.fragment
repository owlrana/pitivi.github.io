It is the grouping\nof three things:\nTO BE DEFINED\n\nBrowser are a unified way of searching/browsing for contents and\ndevices, or more generally speaking Media Assets.\nThis includes, but is not limited to:\nSee Browsers for\nmore details.\n\nFormatter are responsible for loading/storing Projects from/to various\nfile formats.\nFormatters can also provide subclasses of existing core objects in order\nto store/provide format-specific information.\nSee Formatter\nfor more details.\nWe need to provide some kind of mapping for which UI widget should be\nused for which core component, including subclasses.\n\nThe Core, containing all the project- and timeline-related\ncomponents, a plugin-system and various tools.\nThe User Interface, optional, offering a graphical interface to\nuse Core\n\n\nThe Application, which organizes the projects and pipelines, as\nwell as general application settings.\nThe Projects, centralizing information on editing projects,\nincluding timeline, sources used, settings, ...\nThe Pipelines, allowing\ncombining some Actions (View, Record, Stream,...) with Producers\n(Timeline, File, Camera, VCR, ...) and Consumers (Loudspeakers,\nScreen, File, Network stream,...)\nA Plugin System, allowing adding/modifying/extending features in\nvarious parts of PiTiVi.\nSome Tools, amongst which Browsers (To search/organize/discover\ncontent) and Formatters (To handle various editing projects file\nformats).\nSome utilities, use by various components of core, like a\nDiscoverer (to discover the multimedia properties of contents) and\nThumbnailer (To generically produce thumbnails of contents)\n\n\nThe Settings of the application, user-interface and plugins\nOne or more Project(s), corresponding to the various\nTimelines currently opened.\nOne or more Pipeline(s),\ncorresponding to the various processing pipelines currently used.\n\n\nThe Settings of the project and timeline\nThe History of all events that happened on the Project and the\nTimeline.\nThe SourceBin which are a list of the SourceFactory being used\nin this project. All sources used in the Timeline are present in\nthat list, but it can also contains sources not (yet) used in the\nTimeline.\nThe Timeline. All the\ntimeline editing is done through this object.\n\n\n\nProducer(s) which are generally the contents we're using (Ex:\nTimeline, File, Network Stream, WebCam, DV VCR, ...)\n\nConsumer(s) which convert/process/display streams from the\nProducers (Ex: Encoding to File, Outputting to Screen/Speakers,\nStreaming, recording to DV VCR, ...)\n\nAction(s) which represent meaningful usage of the various\nproducers and consumers (Ex: Record from Webcam, (Pre)View timeline,\nRender Timeline, Capture from DV VCR, ...)\n\n\nLocal File Browser\nHardware Device Browser\nEffect/Operations Browser\nMedia Asset Management Browser\nOnline Service Browser (ex: youtube, flickr, archive.org, ...)\n\n"});
