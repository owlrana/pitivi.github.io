Is a 3D animator working for a gaming company,\nso his editing needs are somewhat different than the average\nvideographer or editor. His duties include producing high-quality stills\nand shorts for promotional purposes, as well as in-game cinematics\n(ICG). Most of his sequences are pre-rendered, and brought in as\nsequenced images. In general, the sequences are rendered to their\nfinished length and only occasionally are the sequences trimmed down.\nAfter lunch with M, he showed me how he performed simple editing tasks\nin Adobe Premiere. He discussed how Premiere differed from its\nalternatives. For comparison he also performed similar tasks in After\nEffects. He commented that Premiere doesn't focus on individual frames.\nAfter Effects is much more focused on frame-accurate editing and\nkeyframing. M. said that he actually preferred using After Effects for\nmost editing tasks. He also showed me how Maya handles animation through\ntwo separate interfaces: the dope sheet, and the graph. The dope sheet\nhearkens back to traditional 2D animation as a means of timing lip\nmovements to speech sounds. The property graph directly displays the\nmathematics of a property as they change over time.\n(*) Statements marked with an asterisk are speculations about other\nuser's preferences, and should be taken with a grain of salt.\n\nWhen moving one source affects all the sources after it, this is\ncalled a “ripple edit”.\nThe project's framerate and resolution are completely determined by\nthe output media. Usually, the editor [person] knows in advance\nwhat their output format is. Changing these settings is not usually\ndone, and when it is, a loss in quality is expected.\nFCP tries to provide direct manipulation of more abstract editing\nconcepts, and high degree of immediate feedback, which is what\npeople like about it. It gets the job done, but things don't seem to\nfeel as tactile or immediate.(*)\nM. claims to have an intuitive feel for “numbers”, meaning numeric\nproperty values. When he sets a key-frame value on a cross-fade, for\nexample, he has a fairly good idea of what 35% means.\nIt's rare that an editor would first move the play-head position to\na point in the timeline that they wanted to see, and then make a cut\nor an edit.\n\n\nPremiere didn't render effects or transitions in real time even on a\npowerful machine.\nPremiere doesn't allow sources to overlap each other in the\ntimeline. Dropping one source onto another causes the new source to\nbe spliced into the existing one. There's no easy way to rejoin the\nsource, though you can always stretch the existing source back to\nits original length.\nApplying a time stretch in premiere was somewhat difficult. In after\neffects, the time remapping feature made complicated frame-rate\nmanipulations a fairly straightforward keyframing process.\n\n\nWhen moving a source, the viewer should show the frame before the\nsource cuts in, rather than the play-head position\nWhen trimming a source, the viewer window should show the start\npoint in that source, rather than where the play-head position.\nPut as much functionality directly in the timeline as possible, as\nit's often easier to manipulate.*\n\n"});
