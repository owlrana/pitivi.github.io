If you want to follow the development progress read\n2008 Jog and Shuttle controls code\nexperiment\n\n\nGlade source file is available upon request.\nThe current and total controls should be able to display in units of\nframes or time.\nI am willing to work on this but will need mentoring. My background:\n\ncurrent: a linkbutton control with which a random position can be\nmanually entered\nzoom: this is of lower priority which allows to set the zooming\nlevel of the image (either fit or a percentage)\ntotal: total time of the clip\njog: with the left mouse down you can jump to previous frames by\nmoving left or to next frames by moving right\nshuttle: with the left mouse down you can rewind or forward with\nvariable speeds\n\n\ngraduated as architect and visual/video artist (I care about\naesthetics and UI design)\nexperience of python (no C or C++)\nplenty of gui experience with wxpython\nauthor of SPE (Python IDE - http://pythonide.stani.be), Phatch\n(Photo Batch Processor - http://photobatch.stani.be) & sdxf.\nnew to pygtk and gstreamer -> mentoring needed\nI don't have a lot of time so I prefer to focus on something I need\nmyself and I can finish\nworking on ubuntu\n\n"});
