fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"design/Multi-Layer_Editing.html#page-description","fragment":"PiTiVi distinguishes between multi-layer and multi-track editing. In\nPiTiVi at 'track' is a separate channel of output. A layer is a separate\ninput stream within a track. Multiple layers in a track combined into a\nsingle output stream. Layers within a track have the same media type as\nthe track itself.\nTracks, on the other hand, may be retained as separate output streams in\nthe final output. All sources in a track have the same media type, but\ndifferent tracks can have any media type that PiTiVi supports. For\nexample, a project might involve a DVD featuring multiple angles. The\nalternate angles are kept on separate video tracks. Or, a project might\nfeature separate audio tracks in foreign languages. But there is no\nlimit to what you can achieve with multiple tracks. For example, a\nplug-in might allow creating stereoscopic movies using two synchronized\nvideo tracks. But that's not all: future releases of PiTiVi will support\nother media types. Subtitle information could be kept on a subtitle\ntrack, or midi data used to control synthesizers and/or lighting systems\ncould be kept on a score track and edited alongside the video.\nMulti-layer editing is how the notion of priority is handled in the UI.\nNumeric priority is mapped to the vertical position of an object in the\ntimeline. The higher the source, the higher the priority. The lower the\nsource, the lower the priority. The object with the highest priority is\nthe output for the track. This object will frequently be a source, but\nit may also be an effect. So, for example, two sources can be mixed\ntogether with a superimpose effect.\nThe user can change the priority of an object by moving it up or down. A\nnew visual layer will be created if necessary.\nThe current implementation supports a limited form of multi-track\nediting: there is one audio and one video track per project. Future\nreleases will support not just multiple audio and video tracks, but\nother media types as well. The key concept of tracks is linking.\nLinking allows sources within separate tracks to work together.\nIndividual tracks can also be enabled or disabled for preview and\nproject rendering. Also, Moving sources between tracks is not ordinarily\npossible.\nLinking means that two sources are associated so that whatever is done\nto one source is also done to the other. A source can have one linked\nsource for every separate output track in the project. Currently this\nmeans that video sources can be linked to audio sources, and audio\nsources can be linked to video sources. Along with support for variable\nnumbers of tracks will come support for multi-clip linking. Finally, one\ntrack can be linked to another track, in which case everything that is\ndone to one track is also done to in accordance with the brother\nprinciple. This is the case, for example, between the default audio and\nvideo tracks.\nA single file might provide audio and video streams, but these are each\nhandled separately within PiTiVi. In order to maintain some coherence\nbetween the two streams, we use the concept of a brother. There is a\nfamilial link between the two sources: some piece of genetic information\nis shared. An object with siblings always knows how to create or find\nits siblings. When an objects siblings are cerated, they are\nautomatically linked together. So, for example, if a video source is\nadded to a video track which is linked to an audio track, the video\nsource's brother(s) are created, and then linked together.\nTo link sources, the sources must first be selected. Each source must be\nin a different output channel, or the link tool will not be active. Once\nactive, clicking on the link tool links sources together. If any\nproperty common to both sources does not match, the difference between\nthem will be preserved across multiple edits. So, for example, if an\naudio clip leads a video clip by a few seconds, both sources will move\ntogether when dragged, but the offset will be preserved. If one source\nis of higher priority (i.e. lower in the timeline), the relative\npriority difference will be maintained if one source changes priority.\nTo unlink sources, select one or more sources. If it is linked, the\nunlink tool will become active. Clicking the unlink tool will break the\nlink between it and any sources to which it is linked. If the sources to\nwhich it is linked are in turn linked to other sources, they're links\nwill be left intact (unless they too are in the current selection).\n"});
