Specifically in current video editors it is possible to create a group that contains partially transparent content at Layer and Layer but none at Layer so that a timeline object that is not part of the group may be blended between two objects that are part of the group. In my view this behavior is not really desirable and the simplicity of a group is a timeline object is worth the loss of functionality. \n"});
