Will be they considered as a video clip with\ncorresponding properties?\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In the <a href=\"../GES.html\">GES</a> API reference manual, we can see\n<a href=\"http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/TitleSource.html#GES.TitleSource\">GES.TitleSource</a>\nand\n<a href=\"http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/TextOverlay.html#GES.TextOverlay\">GES.TextOverlay</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/TitleSource.html#GES.TitleSource\">GES.TitleSource</a>\nis a title clip/object as you'd imagine it. This is what we are\nusing now.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://lazka.github.io/pgi-docs/#GES-1.0/classes/TextOverlay.html#GES.TextOverlay\">GES.TextOverlay</a>,\non the other hand, is something that is meant to be used really as\nan \u201coverlay on top of an existing video stream\u201d (ex: for subtitles).\nThis probably corresponds to the <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gst-plugins-base-plugins/html/gst-plugins-base-plugins-textoverlay.html\">GStreamer text overlay\nelement</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In Pitivi, we would need one UI that does it all: allow creating a title\nclip/timeline object that may have a transparent background color. That\nway, if the user wants to use it as an overlay on video, he simply needs\nto set the background color to be fully transparent. Only one UI, only\none workflow. More flexibility for the user and less confusion. As you\ncan see in some other applications <a href=\"http://jeff.ecchi.ca/public/vegas-title-editor.webm\">like\nthis</a> (or even in\nkdenlive, I think), having a single UI to do everything feels great. We\ncan do a much better design than them, however!</p>\n<p>We need to extend titlesource to be able to set a background color, or\neven a text border color:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This is probably easy/trivial to fix in GES, you just need to expose\nthe background-color property of GstVideoTestSrc into\nGESTrackVideoTestSource and the expose that in GESTitleSource.</li>\n<li>That way, we can ignore textoverlay completely (titlesource will\njust depend on video compositing being reimplemented later on)</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
