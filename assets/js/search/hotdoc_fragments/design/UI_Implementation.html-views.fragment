fragment_downloaded_cb({"url": "design/UI_Implementation.html#views", "fragment": "Views \nView objects appear exclusively in the time line component of the UI. Each view represents some object in the current timeline. Views must update their appearance when the object they represent changes. While in most cases this will be accomplished by connecting to model signals it is up to the individual view object to do this. No infrastructure is provided by the View base class. In general views should multiply from View and some subclass of goocanvas.Item. The controller code connects to specific signals and expects that these signals will have the same signature as defined in goocanvas.Item. \nViews provide a public interface for controlling appearance. There are independent visual states \nA fourth state normal is defined as being simultaneously unfocused inactive and deselected. \n"});
