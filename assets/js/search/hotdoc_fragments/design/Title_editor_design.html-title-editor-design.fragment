Please improve correct this page with your knowledge. \nThe question in everyone s mind \nWhat we should do in case of titles and text overlays with video compositing Will be they considered as a video clip with corresponding properties \nIn the GES API reference manual we can see GES.TitleSource and GES.TextOverlay. \nIn Pitivi we would need one UI that does it all allow creating a title clip timeline object that may have a transparent background color. That way if the user wants to use it as an overlay on video he simply needs to set the background color to be fully transparent. Only one UI only one workflow. More flexibility for the user and less confusion. As you can see in some other applications like this or even in kdenlive I think having a single UI to do everything feels great. We can do a much better design than them however \nWe need to extend titlesource to be able to set a background color or even a text border color \n"});
