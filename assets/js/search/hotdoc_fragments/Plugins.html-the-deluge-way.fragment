Each subdirectory takes the name of the contained plugin. Each plugin should at least provide an __init__.py file which defines the custom namespace and provides the access points for the plugin. \nInside the __init__.py are stored \nThe plugin manager scans the plugin directory for new items and when a plugin is found it imports the namespace into the list of plugins and calls the deluge_init function to initialize the plugin. \nThis implementation has the major advantage of being lightweight. \nIt does not create a class hierarchy for plugins this can be both an advantage and an handicap since changes in the common base plugin class would potentially break plugin s compatibility but having a common ancestor can simplify usual operation by defining them inside the ancestor. \nIt is not possible to categorize plugins even if a simple category field inside the __init__.py would be enough. \nThis plugin architecture is useful for extending the application with functionality not considered in the core objects since the plugin has full control over the application and can thus extend any aspect of the host. \n"});
