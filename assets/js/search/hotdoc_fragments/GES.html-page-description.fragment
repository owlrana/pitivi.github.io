GES simplifies the creation of multimedia editing applications. Basically GES is a complete SDK for making a video editor but not only that \nTraditionally Pitivi was a user interface and a homemade video editing core or backend that interacted directly with GNonLin. Starting in version Pitivi s core has been replaced by GES. This means that Pitivi is mostly only a user interface on top of GES. Starting in version GNonLin has been replaced by Non Linear Engine to improve stability. \nGES does not aim at serving the needs of Pitivi only we are building the platform of the future and breaking the cycle of failed projects. Indeed other applications are already using GES or migrating to it. \nPitivi is one of the generous projects that develops not just an editor but a set of libraries to implement editors. Applications built on top of those libraries are not really re inventing the wheel they can piggyback on top of the work that these folks are doing and then implement UI features that they care about the most.
