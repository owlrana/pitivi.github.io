GES simplifies the\ncreation of multimedia editing applications. Basically, GES is a\ncomplete <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sdk\">SDK</a> for making a video\neditor (but not only that).</p>\n<p>Traditionally, Pitivi was a user interface and a homemade video editing\n\u201ccore\u201d (or \u201cbackend\u201d) that interacted directly with\n<a href=\"attic/GNonLin.html\">GNonLin</a>. Starting in version\n<a href=\"releases/0.91.html\">0.91</a>, Pitivi's core has been replaced by GES. This\nmeans that Pitivi is mostly only a user interface on top of GES.\nStarting in version <a href=\"releases/0.95.html\">0.95</a>, GNonLin has been replaced\nby Non-Linear Engine to improve stability.</p>\n<p>GES does not aim at serving the needs of Pitivi only: we are building\nthe platform of the future and breaking the cycle of failed projects.\nIndeed, other applications are already using GES or migrating to it.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>\u201cPitivi is one of the 'generous' projects that develops not just an\neditor, but a set of libraries to implement editors. [Applications\nbuilt on top of those libraries] are not really re-inventing the\nwheel, they can piggyback on top of the work that these folks are\ndoing, and then implement UI features that they care about the\nmost.\u201d</em><br>\n\u2014 Bassam Kurdali, director of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephants_Dream\">Elephants\nDream</a> and\n<a href=\"http://urchn.org\">Tube</a>.\ufeff</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In addition to the fact that GES encourages code reuse among audio/video\nediting software, here are some concrete advantages that we've noticed\nwhile porting Pitivi to GES:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It solves many architectural issues of the past.</li>\n<li>It vastly simplifies Pitivi development:\n<ul>\n<li>More than 20 000 lines of code have been removed from Pitivi as\na result</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2012/01/12/spring-clean-up-in-january/\">A big\ncleanup</a>\nof the Pitivi codebase was done in early 2011, significantly\nreducing the amount of modules/files to deal with.</li>\n<li>No more confusion between the UI and backend parts</li>\n<li>Much less GStreamer knowledge is required to contribute to\nPitivi itself.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>It has much better performance.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Further reading for contributors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>See the <a href=\"Architecture.html\">Architecture</a> page for a visual\noverview of the relationship between Pitivi, GES, Non-Linear Engine\nand other components.</li>\n<li>Read the <a href=\"http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/doc/gstreamer/head/gstreamer-editing-services/html/\">GES API reference\ndocumentation</a>\nif you need to interact with GES.
