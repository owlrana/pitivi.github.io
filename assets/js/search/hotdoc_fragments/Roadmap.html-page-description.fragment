fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Roadmap.html#page-description","fragment":"This is intended to be a general overview of the very\nimportant or big features/improvements we are working on, or planning.\nFor a list of smaller features see fun tasks for\nnewcomers.\nWhat keeps us busy in general?\nAny time estimates here are mostly wild guesses. Do not treat them as\nhard deadlines. This aims mostly at giving an idea of how milestones\nfollow each other.\nSee Current events for past items.\nStatus: started\nWe have a Homebrew recipe\nfor building Pitivi, but we still have to integrate Matplotlib and\nmake a standalone DMG out of that.\n\n\nFixing bugs. Improving reliability and ease of use is never\n“done”. We have\ntons of work.\nHelp is very welcome!\n\nImproving GStreamer. This benefits not only Pitivi, but other\nmultimedia applications as well.\n\nWorking on features: Until we reach 1.0, only\nif they improve stability.\n\n\n2019 Q1: release 1.0 with ponies and rainbows\n\n\nStatus: started\nSee issue 632\n\n\n\nStatus: some effects like\nalphaspot and\ncolor corrector\nalready have a custom UI. The overall experience can be smoother.\nStill to do: green screen\ncompositing,\naudio equalizer\n\n\n\nSee issue 930\n\n\n\nThe current title editor UI is very simple. Please join us to make\nit work up to your expectations! See the existing title editor\nissues.\n\n\n\nDigital asset\nmanagement\nis the ability to manage huge amounts of media (video clips, sounds,\nimages, etc.). This feature is very much needed for professional\nediting; it allows handling multiple simultaneous camera angles,\nmultiple takes of the same scene, multiple sound sources, etc.\nPotentially being addressed by the Novacut team with\ndmedia\n\n\n\nSince GStreamer 1.2, the basic infrastructure allowing us to cleanly\ntake advantage of the video decoding capabilities of modern graphic\ncards is there. We need to ensure that our planned usecases are\nproperly supported with the most common graphic drivers (through\nVA-API) and to make the integration work in Pitivi.\n\n\nStatus: done but\nthe proxy experience can be better\nSee proxy editing\nrequirements for the “spec”\nof how this feature should behave\n\n"});
