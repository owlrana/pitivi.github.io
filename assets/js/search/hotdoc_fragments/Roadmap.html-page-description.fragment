The overall experience can be smoother.\nStill to do:\nSince GStreamer 1.2, the basic infrastructure allowing us to cleanly take\nadvantage of the video decoding capabilities of modern graphic cards is there.\nWe need to ensure that our planned usecases are properly supported with the most\ncommon graphic drivers (through VA-API) and to make the integration work in\nPitivi.\n\n\nFixing bugs. Improving reliability and ease of use is never\n“done”. We have\ntons of work.\nHelp is very welcome!\n\nImproving GStreamer. This benefits not only Pitivi, but other\nmultimedia applications as well.\n\nWorking on features. With you!\n\n\n\ngreen screen compositing,\naudio equalizer\n\n"});
