fragment_downloaded_cb({"url":"Roadmap.html#page-description","fragment":"This is intended to be a general overview of the very\nimportant or big features/improvements we are working on, or planning.\nFor a list of smaller features see fun tasks for\nnewcomers.\nWhat keeps us busy in general?\nAny time estimates here are mostly wild guesses. Do not treat them as\nhard deadlines. This aims mostly at giving an idea of how milestones\nfollow each other.\nSee Current events for past items.\nBesides the items below we care about, see also the list of\nGSoC project ideas.\n\n\nFixing bugs. Improving reliability and ease of use is never\n“done”. We have\ntons of work.\nHelp is very welcome!\n\nImproving GStreamer. This benefits not only Pitivi, but other\nmultimedia applications as well.\n\nWorking on features: Until we reach 1.0, only\nif they improve stability.\n\n\n2019 Q4: release 1.0 with ponies and rainbows\n\n\nStatus: started\nSee issue 632\n\n\n\nStatus: some effects like\nalphaspot and\ncolor corrector\nalready have a custom UI. The overall experience can be smoother.\nStill to do: green screen\ncompositing,\naudio equalizer\n\n\n\nSince GStreamer 1.2, the basic infrastructure allowing us to cleanly\ntake advantage of the video decoding capabilities of modern graphic\ncards is there. We need to ensure that our planned usecases are\nproperly supported with the most common graphic drivers (through\nVA-API) and to make the integration work in Pitivi.\n\n"});
