It's also popular -- even lots of open source types lug\naround a MacBook of some kind. Think of applications as a free software\ngateway drug! ;)</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-status\">Current status</h2>\n<p>Pitivi runs pretty well on Mac, but consider it alpha quality. A few\n<a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/project/view/123/\">bugs</a> have been\nfiled already. If you are interested please <a href=\"http://www.pitivi.org/?go=contact\">get in\ntouch</a>!</p>\n<p>Besides fixing bugs, we need to prepare somehow out of the <a href=\"https://github.com/aleb/homebrew-gui/blob/master/pitivi.rb\">Homebrew\nformula</a> a\nproper Mac app. Help is welcome!</p>\n<h2 id=\"installing\">Installing</h2>\n<p>First install <a href=\"http://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a> then run:</p>\n<p><code>\u00a0brew\u00a0install\u00a0aleb/gui/pitivi</code></p>\n<p>To run Pitivi, run in a terminal:</p>\n<p><code>\u00a0pitivi</code></p>\n<p>Please report bugs to\n<a href=\"https://phabricator.freedesktop.org/project/view/123/\">phabricator</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"hacking\">Hacking</h2>\n<p>Mac OS X has a few major differences from Linux:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>GTK+ uses Quartz backend instead of X11</li>\n<li>When building for multi-arch, a single filesystem hierarchy with\n\u201cfat binaries\u201d is used, rather than separate directories for\nlibs/executables in each arch.\n<ul>\n<li>This causes some issues with gobject-introspection, in that\nattempting to support multi-arch (\u201cUniversal\u201d) builds requires\nadjusting paths to the gir files. Currently this has been\nremoved from cerbero's build scripts, so you'll only get a\n64-bit build. But this might change again.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Applications are usually \u201cbundled\u201d into relocatable 'Foo.app'\ndirectories which encapsulate their binaries, libraries, and shared\ndata.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"development-environment\">Development environment</h2>\n<p>Have a look at <a href=\"HACKING.html\">HACKING</a> to see how to clone a local repository.</p>\n<p>To be able to run <code>./configure</code>, you need to add\n<code>/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin/</code> to <code>PATH</code> so that <code>msgfmt</code> can be found.</p>\n<p>You should be able to run <code>bin/pitivi</code></p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\t"});
