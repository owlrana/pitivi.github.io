You can even subscribe to tasks on Phabricator to keep yourself updated with their progress. If you re a newcomer wanting to contribute you can start with tasks tagged Pitivi tasks for newcomers to get involved. \nTo fix a task it s best to get in touch with us on our IRC channel pitivi on Freenode to see if it s still meaningful then if all is well \nAssign the task to yourself in Phabricator. \nCreate a new branch with a relevant name. Make sure to set its remote tracking branch as it determines the default commit range to attach. For example if you re going to work on task T7674 the branch could be called T7674 import img or T7674 fix import i.e. git checkout b T7674 import img origin master. \nOnce you have made your changes you need to create a commit. Follow the GNOME guidelines for creating commits. \nBe aware that when you create a commit pre commit is executed to perform checks on the changes and in some cases it does some automatic fixes. When this happens make sure those are included in the commit you want to create. \nNow you re all set to push your first diff to Phabricator for review \nOptionally you can set git phab to automatically push your WIP branches to a personal remote repository \nAdd your cloned remote Pitivi repository as a remote to your local repository \nSet git phab remote to your cloned remote Pitivi repository \n"});
