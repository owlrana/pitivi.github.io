I recommend Sublime or Notepad \nSadly I do not know how to make a bat available in the task bar dock so make a link on the Desktop. \nThis needs to be configured to be able to use the package manager mingw get. \nmingw get install mintty \nNow we need to set it as the default shell \nAdd following line to C MinGW msys mys.bat after line \nset MSYSCON mintty.exe \nIt its scaled dynamically. You can copy with just selecting text. You can paste with middle click. Cool. \nWe will need to add everything to our path manually. \nAdd the following lines at the end of C MinGW msys etc profile \nexport PATH PATH c Python27 export PATH PATH c Program Files x86 Git bin export PATH PATH home bmonkey cerbero export PATH PATH c Program Files x86 CMake bin \nalias cerbero cerbero uninstalled \nNote that the cerbero path is the path where we will clone cerbero into in the next step. You need to change it to your user name. \nSave the file and restart your shell. \nThe bootstrap will fail if git config is not set up. Do the following \ngit config global user.email you example.com git config global user.name Your Name \ngit clone git anongit.freedesktop.org gstreamer cerbero \nNow we need to get some extra dependencies from mingw get to start the bootstrap. \nmingw get.exe install msys perl msys patch msys bison msys flex msys coreutils \nNow we can start cerbero bootstrap. \nIf you cannot access the cerbero command make sure its in the PATH in your bash profile. \ncerbero bootstrap \nGo get some coffee. \ncerbero build gst editing services \nGo plant a tree. This can take hours. \nSince GES does not depend on all plugins you need to build them manually. \ncerbero build gst plugins bad cerbero build gst plugins ugly cerbero build gst libav \nYou propably want to use ges launch exe and friends in the shell. To do this add the dist folder to the PATH. \nIn your bash profle \nexport PATH PATH home bmonkey cerbero dist windows_x86_64 bin \nIf you encounter the configure process to freeze you need to close the shell and kill all sh.exe processes in the task manager. Alternatively you can log out and log in. \nchecking for msgfmt... c Users Lubosz cerbero build tools bin msgfmt checking for gmsgfmt... c Users Lubosz cerbero build tools bin msgfmt checking for xgettext... c Users Lubosz cerbero build tools bin xgettext checking for msgmerge... \n"});
