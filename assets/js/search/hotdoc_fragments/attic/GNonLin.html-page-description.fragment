The goals of the GNonLin elements are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To be GStreamer <strong>elements</strong>, and therefore integrating themselves\nperfectly into any GStreamer pipeline,</li>\n<li>To <strong>not use any specific API</strong>, except for the GStreamer/GObject\nAPI, making them easy to use with any language already supporting\nthe GStreamer API,</li>\n<li>To provide somewhat of an \u201cediting point-of-view\u201d to using gstreamer\n(sources, effects, position in time, ...),</li>\n<li>To be non-destructive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Initially created to be used in video editors, GNonLin was also made\ngeneric so it can be used for audio editors, jukebox applications,\nslideshows, live editing, etc.</p>\n<p>While GNonLin was historically used as the sole editing backend for\nPitivi, Jokosher and other applications, it is <strong>not</strong> recommended to\nuse GNonLin directly anymore, unless you have a special appetite for\nunwarranted pain and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics. Instead, you should use\n<a href=\"../GES.html\">GES</a>.</p>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
