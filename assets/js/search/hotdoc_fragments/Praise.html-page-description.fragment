I have found a legitimate video editor for Linux that is more powerful than Lightworks that uses the latest GTK technologies and it s available to run right now with one download no proprietary counter. It s Pitivi. They just had a brand new version and it s a huge huge deal. I m not joking this is a really big deal. They ve been essentially working on this release for over a year and they have done SO. MUCH. WORK. It s almost an entirely new product. They ve redone everything. This looks like an actual video editor If you re familiar with Final Cut this is going to be a familiar editing experience for you. This is a whole new deal. I m excited. \nChris Fisher on the Linux Action Show episode from to mins \nPitivi es uno de los mejores editores de v deo para Linux que he se puede encontrar en la actualidad. La interfaz es sencilla y agradable a la vista no hay complicaciones de ning n tipo una de esas perlas de software que no se ven a menudo y que conviene tener siempre a mano. translated One of the best video editors for Linux that I can find today. The interface is simple and pleasing to the eye no complications... a rare gem that you don t see often in the software world and something you should have on hand. \nUpToDown September \nIt is a testimony to Pitivi s stability that the only problems I found with it were minor. Obviously the big plus is the vast assortment of effects available and how easy they are to configure and use. But the collective effect of the UI improvements settings presets detachable tabs and other enhancements fully adjustable frame rates media previews make for a better editing experience as well. \nLinux.com July th \nWhat impresses me about Pitivi isn t so much that it s a flexible multimedia editor we have a handful of those already in the Linux community. What I think sets Pitivi apart is that it makes video editing intuitive. I don t generally create or edit video files but I was able to jump right in with this application. I didn t have any need for a manual or tutorial Pitivi has an interface which allows people to learn by doing without a bunch of scary options or jargon. Almost everything is drag n drop with this editor and I feel it lowers the bar for people interested in putting together their own videos. \nDistroWatch October th \nI have to say the work Thibault and the Pitivi guys have done is incredible. Truly. The wide selection of effects and the ease in which they can be added used is so simple and user intuitive it can t help but stoke your creative fire. The process for editing adjusting clip effects in Pitivi certainly scores one up here. Where OpenShot hides effect preferences behind right clicks and extra windows Pitivi puts them slapbang where you can see and access them equalling a usability plus. All of this is done in real time too As soon as you drag an effect on a clip it s instantly applied. This makes workflow irrepressibly speedy you can see what works and what doesn t straight away. I am utterly utterly astounded by the quality handling fantastic interface this has gained in such a short amount of time. It is a absolute credit to the talents of the team behind this and it s not even released yet \nOMG Ubuntu on the inclusion of special effects in September \nOverall Pitivi is a promising application. It s a decent video editor with no frills and intuitive to pick up. And in the tests I ran Pitivi was rock solid. This isn t something to be taken for granted. Years ago I spent time editing video with Kino for various projects and learned to save after nearly every edit or operation. \nars technica February st \nI shuddered at the thought of editing on Linux as every piece of software I d tried was extremely buggy and always crashed at some point in the process. After seeing a comment in this subreddit I decided to give Pitivi a chance and I was blown away. It is not the most feature packed editor kdenlive but it did exactly what I needed it to do I imported video made cuts added transitions added titles and rendered out a min video to ProRes. Not a single glitch in the whole process. Also it looks great If any Pitivi developers are reading THANK YOU You have made a functional video editor under Linux. Looking forward to your release. \ntheray76 on Reddit \nI ve spent years looking for a simple stable video editor to fit into my Linux GNOME desktop experience. Flatpak and Pitivi installation via flapak is simple and it works. Pitivi is a great release. It s stable responsive and it works. Kudos to the Pitivi developers and wider community. if you re like me and you ve been waiting on the sidelines for a simple stable video editor for Linux and in particular the GNOME GTK environment then I recommend you give Pitivi a try. \nmaheart on Reddit \nI have worked as video editor in my earlier life before I became software programmer and used Final Cut Pro. I have always been a Linux user though and have meddled with everything that exist every single year. Cinelerra was always the fall back that would never really let me down because it was frank about its crashers and they were possible to navigate around. \nIn later years I did find Pitivi to be a possible replacement for simple out to blog cuts. Especially the version before they added filters. Sadly the filters version exposed lots of bugs in the underlying stack and everything became dog slow and probably quite unstable. I just stuck with that old now very old version. \nHowever the new GES backed line that is aiming at becoming is something totally different. It is really shaping up to becoming a quite awesome little video editor and I will be donating happily. \nOdin H rthe Omdal on the fundraiser coverage article on OMG Ubuntu February \n"});
