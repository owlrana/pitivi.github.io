I have found a legitimate video editor for Linux,\nthat is more powerful than Lightworks, that uses the latest GTK\ntechnologies, and it's available to run right now with one download,\nno proprietary counter. It's Pitivi. They just had a brand new\nversion, 0.95, and it's a huge, huge deal. I'm not joking, this is a\nreally big deal. [...] They've been essentially working on this\nrelease for over a year, and they have done SO. MUCH. WORK. It's\nalmost an entirely new product. They've redone everything. [...]\nThis looks like an actual video editor! [...] If you're familiar\nwith Final Cut this is going to be a familiar editing experience for\nyou. [...] This is a whole new deal. I'm excited.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014 Chris Fisher on the <a href=\"http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/90616/the-evolution-of-solus-las-392/\">Linux Action Show, episode\n392</a>\n(from 22 to 32 mins), 2015</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cPitivi es uno de los mejores editores de v\u00eddeo para Linux que he se\npuede encontrar en la actualidad.

(...) Obviously the big plus is the vast\nassortment of effects available, and how easy they are to configure\nand use. But the collective effect of the UI improvements (settings\npresets, detachable tabs) and other enhancements (fully adjustable\nframe rates, media previews) make for a better editing experience as\nwell.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014\n<a href=\"http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/465688-pitivi-video-editor-now-kitten-friendly\">Linux.com</a>,\nJuly 6th, 2011</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cWhat impresses me about Pitivi isn't so much that it's a flexible\nmultimedia editor \u2014 we have a handful of those already in the Linux\ncommunity. What I think sets Pitivi apart is that it makes video\nediting intuitive. I don't generally create or edit video files, but I\nwas able to jump right in with this application. I didn't have any\nneed for a manual or tutorial (...). Pitivi has an interface which\nallows people to learn by doing without a bunch of scary options or\njargon. Almost everything is drag-n-drop with this editor and I feel\nit lowers the bar for people interested in putting together their own\nvideos.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014\n<a href=\"http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20101025#feature\">DistroWatch</a>,\nOctober 25th, 2010</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201c(...) I have to say the work Thibault and the Pitivi guys have done\nis incredible. Truly. (...) The wide selection of effects and the ease\nin which they can be added/used is so simple and user-intuitive it\ncan\u2019t help but stoke your creative fire. (...) The process for\nediting/adjusting clip effects in Pitivi certainly scores one up here.\nWhere OpenShot hides effect preferences behind right-clicks and extra\nwindows Pitivi puts them slapbang where you can see and access them\nequalling a usability plus. All of this is done in real-time, too: As\nsoon as you drag an effect on a clip it\u2019s instantly applied. This\nmakes workflow irrepressibly speedy; you can see what works and what\ndoesn\u2019t straight away. (...) I am utterly, utterly astounded by the\nquality, handling &amp; fantastic interface this has gained in such a\nshort amount of time. It is a absolute credit to the talents of the\nteam behind this \u2013 and it\u2019s not even released yet!\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>\u2014 <a href=\"http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/09/pitivi-video-effects-ubuntu-download/\">OMG!\nUbuntu!</a>\non the inclusion of special effects in September 2010</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOverall, Pitivi is a promising application. It's a decent video\neditor with no frills, and intuitive to pick up. And in the tests I\nran, Pitivi was rock-solid. This isn't something to be taken for\ngranted.

After seeing a comment in this subreddit, I\ndecided to give Pitivi a chance, and I was blown away. It is not the\nmost feature-packed editor (kdenlive), but it did exactly what I\nneeded it to do: I imported video, made cuts, added transitions, added\ntitles, and rendered out a 30min video to ProRes. Not a single glitch\nin the whole process. Also, it looks great! If any Pitivi developers\nare reading, THANK YOU! You have made a functional video editor under\nLinux.
