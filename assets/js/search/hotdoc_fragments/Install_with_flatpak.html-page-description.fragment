The repository contains only bit builds. \nIf you see problems come to our IRC channel or file a bug. \nSee the flatpak website for how to install flatpak for your distribution. \nYou need to log out in again after installing flatpak for apps to show up in menus. Until you log out in the flatpak data directories aren t part of your desktop environment s search path. This needs to be done only one time. \nTo install the latest stable Pitivi release run as a normal user no root nor sudo \nTo install the latest Pitivi development snapshot run \nTo install the development version including the latest features run \nYou might want to use Pitivi master to contribute and help us test Pitivi or if a specific bug which annoys you is fixed in master etc. \nYou can now launch Pitivi from your applications menu as any other installed application. \nYou can also re run the installer which launches Pitivi after updating to the latest version. \nTo see if warning or error messages are printed in the console run \nIf for some reason you need to use an older Pitivi version run \nTo update Pitivi to the latest version you can just run again the installer the same way as before. \nAlternatively update by using directly flatpak \nIf a new version is fetched it will be made current. \nIf your software manager doesn t allow this yet run the command below \nIn the sandbox gstreamer vaapi is installed but it requires the org.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel extension to be installed. \nAs the support is experimental you need to set PITIVI_UNSTABLE_FEATURES to enable them \n"});
