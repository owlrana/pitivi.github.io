Until you log out/in, the flatpak data directories aren't\npart of your desktop environment's search path. This needs to be done\nonly one time.\nCurrently there are no less than three options for installing Pitivi. Each\ncan be installed by running the commands below as normal user, no root/sudo\nneeded.\nYou can now launch Pitivi from your applications menu as any other\ninstalled application.\nYou can also re run the installer which launches Pitivi after updating\nto the latest version.\nTo see if warning or error messages are printed in the console, run:\nIf for some reason you need to use an older Pitivi version, run:\nIf your software manager doesn't allow this yet, updating manually by running:\nIf a new version is fetched, it will be made current.\nIf your software manager doesn't allow this yet, run the command below:\nIn the sandbox gstreamer-vaapi is installed but it requires the\norg.freedesktop.Platform.VAAPI.Intel extension to be installed.\nAs the support is experimental, you need to set PITIVI_UNSTABLE_FEATURES\nto enable them:\n\n\nlatest release, for production work:\n\n\n\n1.0 development snapshot, for testing the next release:\n\n\n\nmaster development snapshot, which includes the latest features:\n\n"});
