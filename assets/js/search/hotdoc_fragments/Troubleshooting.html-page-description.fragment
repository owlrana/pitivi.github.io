Sometimes, restarting Pitivi may solve the\nproblem. To be exact, it is a good practice to restart it between\ntries when trying to investigate and isolate bugs. In the next version\nof Pitivi based on <a href=\"GES.html\">GES</a>, rendering errors will be\n<a href=\"http://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2013/04/28/no-more-stuck-render-dialogs/\">shown to\nyou</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"i-use-cinnamon-and-i-cant-select-clips-in-the-timeline-\">I use cinnamon and I can't select clips in the timeline !</h2>\n<p>As of April 2014, we have spotted that issue. A bug report has been\nopened against cinnamon here :\n<a href=\"https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2993\">https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2993</a>. Until the next\nversion of cinnamon, the solution is to \u201cunset CLUTTER_DISABLE_XINPUT\u201d\nbefore launching pitivi.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rendering-hangs-at-1-second-or-less-remaining\">Rendering hangs at 1 second (or less) remaining</h2>\n<p>This is a known bug with Pitivi 0.15.x. There are several ways you can\nreduce the probability of this happening:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you have extremely long clips (ie: hours) or heavy media files\n(ie: gigabytes) in your timeline, try with smaller clips for the\nsake of testing</li>\n<li>Make sure the audio track and the video track cover the whole\ntimeline, without gaps. This means you must have at least one audio\nclip under the playhead at all times, and that the beginning/end of\nthe timeline must match between video and audio.</li>\n<li>If you're using PNG images, try with JPEGs instead.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These tricks are not guaranteed to work in all situations, but they are\nsome of the most common causes of rendering failing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"rendering-doesnt-start-stuck-at-estimating\">Rendering doesn't start (stuck at \u201cestimating\u201d)</h2>\n<p>This might be due to many reasons, including an invalid codecs\ncombination, incorrect codec settings, or something else.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-rendered-files-weighs-0-bytes\">\u201cThe rendered files weighs 0 bytes!\u201d</h3>\n<p>That's <a href=\"https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=692316\">bug 692316</a>,\nwhich is most likely fixed for future versions of Pitivi\n(<a href=\"releases/0-91.html\">0.91</a> and newer). In that case, the workaround is\nsimply to try starting the render again.</p>\n<h3 id=\"make-sure-you-have-the-proper-codecs\">Make sure you have the proper codecs</h3>\n<p>Some codecs in GStreamer (such as Dirac) are not reliable for use with\nPitivi. When rendering, we recommend you try the following combinations\nof containers and codecs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Webm\n<ul>\n<li>VP8 video</li>\n<li>Vorbis audio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>OGG\n<ul>\n<li>Theora video</li>\n<li>Vorbis audio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Matroska\n<ul>\n<li>x264enc (H.264 video)</li>\n<li>AAC audio</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Starting with Pitivi <a href=\"releases/0-91.html\">0.91</a>, this will not be an issue\nanymore, as bad quality codecs will not show up.</p>\n<h3 id=\"incorrect-codec-settings\">Incorrect codec settings</h3>\n<p>Some codecs require video resolution width and height to be multiples of\n4, 8 or 16. Typically, always make sure that they're at least multiples\nof 2. Otherwise, some video codecs won't encode at all, sometimes\nthey'll encode with suboptimal or broken results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"playback-performance-is-bad\">Playback performance is bad</h2>\n<p>See <a href=\"Performance_problems.md\">Performance problems</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-recommended-rendering-settings-to-export-to-youtube\">What are the recommended rendering settings to export to YouTube?</h2>\n<p>\u201cWhy don't Theora files work on YouTube?\u201d</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Youtube doesn't support Theora 1.1 videos. Uploading such files will\nresult in a garbled/corrupt green video.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For files destined to YouTube, you could use this combination:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Container: Matroska (.mkv): matroskamux</li>\n<li>Video codec: H.264: x264enc</li>\n<li>Audio codec: AAC</li>\n</ul>\n\n</div>\n\n\n        "});
