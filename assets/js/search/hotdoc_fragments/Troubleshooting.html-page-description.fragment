Issues will be removed as they get fixed or relatively soon afterwards See also the list of bugs related to rendering. See Bug reporting for instructions on how to get debug logs to be used for debugging and troubleshooting. \nTip restart Pitivi between tries \nWhen an error happens it is possible that Pitivi may enter an inconsistent state ie the UI is not responsive anymore or actions don t seem to do anything Sometimes restarting Pitivi may solve the problem. To be exact it is a good practice to restart it between tries when trying to investigate and isolate bugs. In the next version of Pitivi based on GES rendering errors will be shown to you. \nAs of April we have spotted that issue. A bug report has been opened against cinnamon here https github.com linuxmint Cinnamon issues Until the next version of cinnamon the solution is to unset CLUTTER_DISABLE_XINPUT before launching pitivi. \nThis is a known bug with Pitivi x. There are several ways you can reduce the probability of this happening \nThese tricks are not guaranteed to work in all situations but they are some of the most common causes of rendering failing. \nThis might be due to many reasons including an invalid codecs combination incorrect codec settings or something else. \nThat s bug which is most likely fixed for future versions of Pitivi and newer In that case the workaround is simply to try starting the render again. \nSome codecs in GStreamer such as Dirac are not reliable for use with Pitivi. When rendering we recommend you try the following combinations of containers and codecs \nStarting with Pitivi this will not be an issue anymore as bad quality codecs will not show up. \nSome codecs require video resolution width and height to be multiples of or Typically always make sure that they re at least multiples of Otherwise some video codecs won t encode at all sometimes they ll encode with suboptimal or broken results. \nSee Performance problems. \nWhy don t Theora files work on YouTube \nFor files destined to YouTube you could use this combination \n"});
