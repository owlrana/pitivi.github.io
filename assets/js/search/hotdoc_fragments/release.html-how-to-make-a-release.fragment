This branch would be used to gather backported fixes and be the official branch for doing a X.YY.Z bug fix release. \nSend out an announcement mail to \nOn pitivi.org update releases.txt for the app s update notification feature \nBump the Z in the version number in meson.build for example if it was a regular release or if it was a bug fix release and commit a m Back to development \n"});
