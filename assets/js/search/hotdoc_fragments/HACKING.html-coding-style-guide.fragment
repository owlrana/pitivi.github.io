Since Python is a very concise compact language we can afford to be a little bit more flexible on the line length than languages such as C. \nWhen deciding whether or not you should split your line when it exceeds characters ask yourself Does it truly improve legibility \nWhat this translates to is \nAvoid having very long lines. \nWhen the contents only slightly exceeds the chars limit consider keeping it on one line. Otherwise it just hurts legibility and gives a weird shape to the code. \n"});
