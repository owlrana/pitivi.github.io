This allowed implementing tagging of\nthe clips in the\nMedia Library.\n\nAyush Mittal simplified the Render\nDialog to avoid overwhelming people, while still allowing full control.\nThe new UI asks only about the desired render preset and quality,\ntaking care of the\nrest.\n\nVivek R implemented object tracking.\nThis required a new GStreamer element which uses\nOpenCV\nto track an object.\nA new UI perspective allows tracking objects and editing the tracked data.\nFor now it's possible to cover each tracked\nobject\nwith a black rectangle.\n\n\n\nMillan Castro implemented timeline\nmarkers.\n\nSwayamjeet Swain\nimplemented support for nested\ntimelines.\n\nYatin Maan improved the effects\nusability.\nThe Effects Library has been refactored to provide a better experience.\n\n\n\nHarish Fulara implemented\na framework for showing different UI perspectives. The existing\nmain UI has been refactored into the EditorPerspective, and\nthe welcome dialog has been replaced by a new gorgeous and modern\nGreeterPerspective.\n\nSuhas Nayak worked on the slow motion\nsupport in GES, but had to interrupt.\n\nYatin Maan implemented support\nfor Scaled Proxies.\n\n\n\nFabián Orccón implemented a\nplugin system\nwhich has been merged. We noticed too late the excellent additional\nDeveloper Console plugin had licensing issues, and it has been\nmerged one year later after Fabian graciously made time to rewrite it.\n\nSuhas Nayak implemented a framework for\nsupporting custom UI for effects,\ninstead of the UI generated automatically. Suhas used the new framework to\nprovide a polished UI for the frei0r-filter-3-point-color-balance and\nalpha effects.\n\nȘtefan-Adrian Popa implemented\nthe UI for the Ken-Burns\neffect,\nincluding keyframing the placement and zoom of the clips by interacting with\nthe viewer. Additionally, Ștefan fixed a lot of bugs most of them unrelated\nto his main\ntask.\n\n\n\nJakub Brindza implemented\ncustomizable keyboard\nshortcuts.\n\n\n\nFabián Orccón worked on the Pitivi,\nGES, GStreamer stack to allow using image sequences.\n\nLubosz Sarnecki worked on\nimplementing a new OpenGL based transformation effect to be used for\nthe transformation UI.\n\n\nAnton Belka worked on the initial\nimplementation of proxies in GES (see proxy\nediting requirements).\nJoris Valette started work on slow/fast-motion in GStreamer.\n\nMathieu Duponchelle\nworked on heavy bugfixing all across the Pitivi, GES and\nGStreamer stack, allowing us to release 0.91 at\nthe end of the summer.\n\nSimon Corsin worked on various pieces\nalongside Mathieu, such as the new waveforms renderer.\n\n\nMatas Brazdeikis implemented a new UI Test\nsuite using Dogtail. He also started the\nimplementation of a title editing user interface.\n\nPaul Lange implemented a manual\nlayer controls user interface for the timeline.\nVolodymyr Rudoy spent some time\ndesigning the GES “Materials” (now known as Assets) API.\n\n\nFeroze Naina worked on adding profiles for rendering.\n\nLubosz Sarnecki implemented a nifty\nuser interface for resizing/cropping clips directly in the\nviewer.\n\nMathieu Duponchelle\nstarted to port PiTiVi to GES after having worked on the GES Python\nbindings and the GES Pitivi formatter.\n\n\n\nThibault Saunier implemented\nwith the core backend developers special effects. He also worked in\nclose collaboration with nekohayo for the user interface and\ntesting.\n\n\n\nBrandon Lewis worked on the advanced\ntimeline.\n\nSarath Lakshman implemented\nwebcam\ncapture.\n\n\n\nBrandon Lewis worked on the simple\ntimeline.\n\n"});
