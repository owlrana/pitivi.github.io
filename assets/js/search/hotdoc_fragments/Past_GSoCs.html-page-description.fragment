Mathieu's work has also been merged, to\nbe part of the 0.91 release.\nThibault's work has been merged in September/October 2010 and is\nexpected to be available to users in releases >0.13.5.\n\n\nHarish Fulara implemented\na framework for showing different UI perspectives. The existing\nmain UI has been refactored into the EditorPerspective, and\nthe welcome dialog has been replaced by a new gorgeous and modern\nGreeterPerspective.\n\nSuhas Nayak worked on the slow motion\nsupport in GES, but had to interrupt.\n\nYatin Maan implemented support\nfor Scaled Proxies.\n\n\n\nFabián Orccón implemented a\nplugin system\nwhich has been merged. We noticed too late the excellent additional\nDeveloper Console plugin had licensing issues, and it has been\nmerged one year later after Fabian graciously made time to rewrite it.\n\nSuhas Nayak implemented a framework for\nsupporting custom UI for effects,\ninstead of the UI generated automatically. Suhas used the new framework to\nprovide a polished UI for the frei0r-filter-3-point-color-balance and\nalpha effects.\n\nȘtefan-Adrian Popa implemented\nthe UI for the Ken-Burns\neffect,\nincluding keyframing the placement and zoom of the clips by interacting with\nthe viewer. Additionally, Ștefan fixed a lot of bugs most of them unrelated\nto his main\ntask.\n\n\n\nJakub Brindza implemented\ncustomizable keyboard\nshortcuts.\n\n\n\nFabián Orccón worked on the Pitivi,\nGES, GStreamer stack to allow using image sequences.\n\nLubosz Sarnecki worked on\nimplementing a new OpenGL based transformation effect to be used for\nthe transformation UI.\n\n\nAnton Belka worked on the initial\nimplementation of proxies in GES (see proxy\nediting requirements).\nJoris Valette started work on slow/fast-motion in GStreamer.\nMathieu Duponchelle worked on heavy\nbugfixing all across the Pitivi, GES and GStreamer\nstack, allowing us to release 0.91 at the end of\nthe summer.\n\nSimon Corsin worked on various pieces\nalongside Mathieu, such as the new waveforms renderer.\n\n\nMatas Brazdeikis implemented a new UI Test\nsuite using Dogtail. He also started the\nimplementation of a title editing user interface.\nPaul Lange implemented a manual layer\ncontrols user interface for the timeline.\nVolodymyr Rudoy spent some time\ndesigning the GES “Materials” (now known as Assets) API.\n\n\nFeroze Naina worked on adding profiles for rendering.\n\nLubosz Sarnecki implemented a nifty\nuser interface for resizing/cropping clips directly in the\nviewer.\nMathieu Duponchelle started to port\nPiTiVi to GES after having worked on the GES Python bindings and the\nGES Pitivi formatter.\n\n\nThibault Saunier implemented with the\ncore backend developers special effects. He also worked in close\ncollaboration with nekohayo for the user\ninterface and testing.\n\n\nBrandon Lewis worked on the advanced\ntimeline.\n\nSarath Lakshman implemented\nwebcam\ncapture.\n\n\nBrandon Lewis worked on the simple\ntimeline.\n\n"});
