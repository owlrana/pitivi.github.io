Note that while we use the word “beta” here,\nthis is the latest “stable” release, and is the one we recommend over\nall previous ones.\nPitivi works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it out,\nhave fun and report detailed bugs for issues\nyou may encounter!\n35 tasks have been closed. See the list of reported tasks that have\nbeen resolved in\n0.98.\nSince the 0.97 release, 175 commits were made in\nPitivi, fixing many bugs.\nWe switched our official Flatpak\nbuild to use Gtk 3.22 and fixed the\nGtk warnings which showed\nup for good reasons. As a result, the timeline code has been greatly\nimproved.\nThanks to Jakub Brindza, our GSoC\nstudent this summer, it is now possible to customize the keyboard\nshortcuts.\nOne nasty bug you might hit is the timeline freezing when you work with\nfile formats which are not officially supported. To workaround it you\nhave to allow the app to create optimized media proxy files when\nimporting the files, and wait for the transcoding to finish before\nadding them to the timeline. This issue is tracked in\nT7626.\nYou can see what's left for 1.0 in the list of currently known\nissues.\nPitivi:\nIn GES (from 1.8.0 to 1.10.2 minus 1.8.2):\nPitivi translations:\n"});
