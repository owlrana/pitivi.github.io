This is mostly a incremental bugfixing release, so\nmake sure to see the 0.91, 0.92\nand 0.93 release notes to get the full picture.\nThis is considered a beta release. As per the feedback we've\nreceived since 0.91 and the many fixes we've made since then, we are\nconfident that the new release series is of much higher quality than the\n0.15 series and older.\nThis release works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it\nout, have fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!\nExecutive summary:\nSee the list of reported bugs that have been resolved in\n0.94.\nSince the 0.93 release, 240 commits were made across 159 files. Here is\na summary of some noteworthy commits:\nIn this release:\nGenerally speaking, you can refer to Pitivi's check.py for the\ndependencies' versions specific to a given release. See also\ndependencies for additional tips.\nSee the list of currently known\nissues,\nthe 0.91, 0.92, 0.93 and 0.94-specific\nissues\nand the list of bugs that need re-testing with\n0.91\n(you can help!)\nIn Pitivi:\nIn GES:\nTranslations:\nA tarball is available on\nhttps://download.gnome.org/sources/pitivi/0.94/\nA bundle usable on any linux distribution is avalaible at:\nSee the Pitivi website and building with\nGES for download and installation\ninstructions.\nFeedback is welcome. See bug reporting for\ntips and tricks.\n\nThe main toolbar and menubar have been replaced by a headerbar and\nmenubutton, saving a significant amount of precious vertical space\nand using the horizontal space better.\nThe viewer has been ported to use a GStreamer GL video output sink\ninstead of the Clutter sink. This solves crashes when running Pitivi\noutside of GNOME Shell and is expected to be a more future-proof\nsolution.\nWe dropped our use of CoGL APIs, namely path_round_rectangle which\ncaused crashes on various Linux distributions shipping a broken\nversion of CoGL\nPitivi has been ported to Python 3\nText wrapping in the rendering progress dialog and title editor has\nbeen fixed\nEffects can now be reordered within a clip's properties\nThe default positioning of UI components (when starting from a fresh\ninstall) has been improved to be balanced properly\nUndocked window components do not shift position on startup anymore\nDocked window components do not shift position on startup anymore,\nwhen the window is not maximized. When the window is maximized, the\nissue remains (your help to investigate this problem is very much\nwelcome, see bug\n723061)\nThe title editor's UI has been simplified, and now supports decimal\nfont sizes\nEducational infobars throughout the UI have been tweaked to make\ntheir colors less intrusive\nVarious issues have been corrected regarding:\n\nDrag and drop in the media library\nAudio waveforms\nUndo/redo\n\n\nThe user manual is now up to date with the state of the new Pitivi\nseries\nPitivi has been ported to GtkApplication, allowing us to remove a\nlot of old code.\nPort deprecated GTK+ widgets to new ones\nTimeline UI animations have been tweaked\nCode refactoring and cleanup all over the place\nVarious build and packaging fixes\nVarious fixes to the test suite\nTranslations have been updated\n\n\nDrag and drop in the media library\nAudio waveforms\nUndo/redo\n\n\nWe have dropped the dependency on ClutterGst\nWe now depend on GStreamer 1.4\nWe now depend on GTK+ 3.10\n\n\nLayer management interface is missing features.\nThe title editor UI is still quite primitive. Please join us to make\nit work up to your expectations! See the existing title editor\nbugs.\nThe transformation box reimplementation is still ongoing (see bug\n708495).\nTranslations are not all fully up to date.\nThe automated codecs installer is (still) broken. See bug\n686182 and GES\nbug 686181.\nThe automatic clip aligner feature does not work. We need someone to\nport it to use our new audio waveforms processing\nmodule.\n\nNo dialog to install missing codecs after discovering\nclips, and no\nerror gets raised in that case. This means that the clip will\n“appear” to have imported correctly, but if you try inserting it\ninto the timeline you may get errors in the background or Pitivi's\nUI may hang.\n\n\n64 bits platforms: http://pitivi.ecchi.ca/bundles/releases/pitivi-0.94-beta-x86_64.tar\n\n32 bits platforms: http://pitivi.ecchi.ca/bundles/releases/pitivi-0.94-beta-x86.tar\n\n\n"});
