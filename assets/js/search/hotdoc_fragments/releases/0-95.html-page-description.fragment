This is mostly an incremental\nbugfixing release, so make sure to see the 0.91,\n0.92, 0.93 and\n0.94 release notes to get the full picture.\nThis is considered a beta release since the “big picture” remains\n“making Pitivi stable” (that's why the next release will bring proxy\nediting). Note that while we use the word “beta” here, this is the\nlatest “stable” release, and is the one we recommend over all previous\nones.\nPitivi works well for us and we make nice movies with it. Try it out,\nhave fun and report detailed bugs for issues you may encounter!\nBlog post associated with this release:\nhttp://jeff.ecchi.ca/blog/2015/11/19/pitivi-0-95-enfant-suisse/\n82 tasks have been closed, See the list of reported tasks that have\nbeen resolved in\n0.95.\nSince the 0.94 release, 392 commits were made in Pitivi, fixing many\nbugs and implementing the following features:\nThe timeline has been rewritten using plain GTK+. This means that we do\nnot depend on the Clutter library anymore; it was causing many problems\nfor our use cases.\nThe transformation tool was previously dropped when Pitivi was ported to\nthe GStreamer Editing Services. It has now been reimplemented. While its\ncurrent state means that it lost a few features compared to its previous\nincarnation, it should be more robust and much simpler to maintain.\nThe glimagesink (video rendering widget) was replaced by the new\ngtk(gl)sink, which integrates more cleanly inside the application and\navoids various bugs we used to encounter while embedding the old sink\ninto Gtk.\nIt is now possible to import external files directly into the timeline.\nJust drag & drop from your favorite file manager to create a clip on the\ntimeline.\nWith this new release, we serialize all the operations done by the user\nas\nGstValidateScenarios\n(more details\nhere),\nallowing us to reproduce bugs much more easily. See the bug\nreporting page for details on how to create\nscenario files for testing.\nWe heard 1024x768 is still a thing, so we added some tricks to adapt the\nUI when running on small screens.\nGenerally speaking, you can refer to the bottom of Pitivi's check.py for\nthe dependencies' versions specific to a given release. See also\ndependencies for additional tips.\nSee the list of currently known\nissues\nIn Pitivi:\nIn GES (from 1.4.0 to 1.6.1):\nTranslations:\n\nWe dropped our dependency on Clutter\nWe now depend on GStreamer 1.6\nWe now depend on the new gtksink (from gst-plugins-bad 1.6)\n\n\nSome users might experience a playback performance regression with\nthe new timeline. See ticket\nT3348 for\ndetails, to subscribe yourself or provide feedback for the\ninvestigation.\nThe title editor UI is still quite primitive. Please join us to make\nit work up to your expectations! See the existing\ntitle editor bugs.\nTranslations are not all fully up to date.\nThe automatic clip aligner feature does not work. We need someone to\nport it to use our new audio waveforms processing\nmodule.\n\nNo dialog to install missing codecs after discovering\nclips, and no error gets\nraised in that case. This means that the clip will “appear” to have\nimported correctly, but if you try inserting it into the timeline\nyou may get errors in the background or Pitivi's UI may hang.\n\n"});
