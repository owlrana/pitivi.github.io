The PiTiVi name came from the combination of Epitech and TV \nIn development stalled due to various factors including the fact that Edward the only active PiTiVi developer at that time was hired by Fluendo to work on GStreamer. Improving GStreamer was necessary in order for PiTiVi to be usable but this meant that PiTiVi did not get as much direct development attention. During that time PiTiVi was also rewritten in Python it was initially written in C A more detailed explanation can be read in this blog post by Edward in \nIn early it was decided that PiTiVi had outgrown its original design specifications and needed to be re architected. The result was the Architectural Redesign. In late early it was announced that Collabora Multimedia would invest developer time in improving PiTiVi and hire additional developers to accelerate its pace The results of Collabora s help on that front were dramatic as can be seen in the significant amount of commits in \nIn late early the GES library was created to address many architectural problems around non linear editing with GStreamer. Starting in efforts on the PiTiVi side have been focused on porting to GES cleaning and stabilizing the whole stack PiTiVi GES GNonLin GStreamer and related technologies like GObject introspection while fixing longstanding bugs and adding new features. \nAs part of a website and branding facelift in the traditionally camel cased PiTiVi name was changed to simply Pitivi \nTo this day the project lives on thanks to the continued efforts of many dedicated people. \n"});
